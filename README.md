# TheDreamLens
### An interactive audio-visual cybertext environment. Written and inhabited by the possibly fictional Hendra Wednesday and Autumn Andersen as the experimental music duo New Keys. 

House and grounds kept by Joseph Brown.

Visitors are invited to travel in and around the various pages finding their way around entirely by themselves.  Exploration and haptic experimentation is encouraged.  Find us at https://dreamlens.netlify.app/

This represents the final submission for the Mmus in Creative Practice at Goldsmiths University (2020).

The various rooms contain quotations from "Reynard the Fox" by John Masefield, "The Poetics of Space" by Gaston Bachelard, passing mentions of Truman Capote and excerpts from "The Ruin", "Wulf and Eadwacer", "The Wanderer", "The Nine Herbs Charm" and "Maxims" all of which are anonymous Anglo Saxon manuscripts.
