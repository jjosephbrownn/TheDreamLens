# TheDreamLens
### An interactive audio-visual cybertext environment. Written and inhabited by the possibly fictional Hendra Wednesday and Autumn Andersen as the experimental music duo New Keys. 

House and grounds kept by Joseph Brown.

Visitors are invited to travel in and around the various pages finding their way around entirely by themselves.  Exploration and haptic experimentation is encouraged.  Find us at https://dreamlens.netlify.app/

This represents the final submission for the Mmus in Creative Practice programme at Goldsmiths University (2020).
