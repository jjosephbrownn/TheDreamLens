<h2>Introduction </h2>
<p><i>People will write a song about topic A, but I want to come up with a production method that deals with topic A. The music can speak explicitly about it, but I don’t want to rely on lyrics or language. I want the process to be dealing with the object of critique.</i> </p>

<p>Our home is found in this interactive website environment which generates music and audio-visual scenarios through interaction with texts, star charts, and archives of photographs and maps.  This site was written and maintained by the possibly fictional musicians Autumn Andersen and Hendra Wednesday of the band New Keys.  By situating rooms throughout a discontinuous space we attempt to question both chronological and temporal norms of music listening/making and framings of creativity that centre the coherent subject as the primary generator of art.  A strict or mapped path is not offered, the listener must find their own way through using confusing or muddied signposts.  Navigation is hampered by unreliable gateways, passwords that do not work or hidden portals that turn out to be fakes.  As the listener progresses, footsteps are left behind that are used to build musical information, suggest similar text or image files to be loaded or to generate new ways of navigating the terrain.  The navigation itself acts as an engine to transform the piece of art in increasingly disruptive ways.</p>
<p>The project aims at a subjective, narrative-driven experience of a work of art that depends less on the frame presented by the artist and more on the movement of the listener.  Although, to a certain extent, there will always be a frame (someone had to write the code after all) this project is concerned more with the appearance of non-linearity, of the illusion of disparate states that can arise from determinate sources.  This is inevitable as websites do not just appear, they must be determined, they must contain assets and dependencies and they must be invoked, articulated, their presence (http-) requested, and finally enunciated by a browser.  However, there are routes through these structures and, as Paul Gilroy has suggested, routes can determine roots (Gilroy, 1993: 15-16).</p>
<p>We are keen to allow the visitor some sense of control over their progress – their own interpretation of our messages and maps will be instrumental in the creation of the subsequent music.  There is some precedent in pop music for this kind of staging: Radiohead with their “pay what you feel” release of <i>In Rainbows</i> (Radiohead, 2007); Wayne Krantz’ weekly uploads of live recordings from their residency at 55 Bar in New York (collated in the retrospective <i>Greenwich Mean</i>, 2020); Kaiser Chief’s fourth album <i>The Future is Medieval</i> (2011) which was made available in a pick ‘n’ mix format with fans able to sell on their own compilations for a commission.  These formats destabilise some of the norms of music production and distribution but are limited to a degree by their existence in determinate form.  By removing possibilities for sedimentary determinations accruing over time we hope to allow a degree of interactivity that goes beyond the usual remixing, spatialising, reordering processes inherent in, for example, Nicolás Jaar’s interactive album <i>Telas</i> (2020) which loops sections of the record according to user input but which already possesses a high degree of creative momentum that cannot be derailed (and is available in “solid” form on Jaar’s Bandcamp).</p>
<p>This is a site of ergodic literature, whose traversal and understanding depends upon, and is established by, the interpretative effort of the visitor.  Literature itself makes its own arguments but a house needs to be explored before it can be known properly which is why we continually refer to this place as a mysterious building.  Architecture and space are probably better tools to understand the spatialised, non-linear, hidden and dusty nature of the music than strict musicological or literary methodologies.  </p>
<p>In this sense the site resembles a junk shop rather than the usual metaphor for music that engages with curation: the art gallery.  Both environments are curated but the “direction” of organisation is different: galleries are initiated with a program of curation; junk shops are retroactively curated.  In a junk shop, the objects are accumulated over time in a haphazard fashion within a territory that ascribes them a “waiting to be found” determination that acts from above to designate its own boundaries.  Art galleries tend to accumulate actively, parsing, rejecting and accepting submissions based on formula specific to the rules of the curation in question.  The junk shop curatorial ontology, however, is something of an illusion but the shape of this formula – that some things can be grouped together because of their differences and their lack of prearranged consistency – will form the bare bones of our contextual theory.</p>
<p>The following text will engage with the context and themes that have proven to be important to the construction of this place.  Like the wings of the house the sections presented now are ordered with the same taxonomy that categorises the project itself.  <b>“<a class="miscLink" id="scatTag">Scatter</a>"</b> will deal with narrative, irony, lineage, and fiction; <b>“<a class="miscLink" id="gathTag">Gather</a>"</b> with bodies, identity and subjectivity; <b>“<a class="miscLink" id="cartTag">Cartography</a>"</b> with power, discourse, and musicians; and <b>“<a class="miscLink" id="purpTag">Repurpose</a>"</b> with technology, binaries, exclusionary politics and organicity.  Under the heading <b>“<a class="miscLink" id="miscTag">Miscera</a>"</b> will be found bibliographies, discographies and other sources and <b>“<a class="miscLink" id="lacTag">Lacunae</a>"</b> will hold the appendices and paraphernalia relevant to the project.  In the latter section can be found a thorough “plan” of the site along with technical details.  <b>“<a class="miscLink" id="tatTag">Tatters</a>"</b> will contain concluding remarks.  <u class = "appLink">Underlined comments</u> will suggest links to the appendices and appropriate videos, case studies and diagrams.  <u class = "appLink">See <b>Figure 1</b> in <b>Section 2.2</b> for an explanation of the navigation program and general introduction.</u> The entire commentary is also embedded, with hyperlinks, in the website under the heading Miscera.</p>
