<h1 class = "miscTitle">Scatter – Narrative and Irony</h1>
<p>Perhaps the most important thing that this project attempts is the threading together and disentangling of narrative arcs.  Hopefully it should be apparent by now that there is no main storyline or plot: that’s up to the visitors to create.  Might even go so far as to say that if you think there is a big reveal behind of all of this, if you think there will be a conclusion all wrapped up in a neat little package then you’ve kinda got the wrong idea.  This section will talk about narrative as a shifting, performative and above all indistinct form in which to place musical ideas.</p>
<p>Lee Edelman in <i>No Future</i> places the queer, as a destructive force for heteronormative hegemony, within the discourse of narrative and irony (Edelman, 2007: 23-24).  Narrative put events into an order so that a story might progress: the hero has to go through certain trials before they can get the prize.  Irony as a literary device flows the opposite way.  Narrative puts things together so that they mean something, but irony says something in order not to mean, to give voice to the plurality of meaning that is forgotten in narratival linear signification.  For Edelman this embodies the symbolic queerness within heteronormative society: queerness plays with the solidified expressions of your usual straight-sized culture and tangles them up differently showing the ridiculousness of assuming a single meaning.  Emphatically, queerness is not another “meaning” but acts to corrode meaning itself, it is the surreal set of symbols that make a mockery of sober representations.</p>
<p>Edelman himself traces the path of certain narratives by focussing on the obsession of heteronormative culture with children ensuring the inheritances of the present (Edelman, 2007: 3).  This sort of futurity is inherently homophobic as it figures the future as a product of heterosexual production, childbirth, marriage etc.  Really, it’s a way of excluding supposedly non-productive members of a community from engaging with a future at all and effectively fencing in any non-heterosexual desire/activities/organising as futile, pointless, decadent or downright dangerous.  Just look at Voldemort, leader of a death cult (oral-centric obviously, Death<i>eaters</i>), obsessed with immortality (unnatural extension of life, the only way straight society can imagine a future homosexual who can bear no children), ambiguously gendered, inhuman, disruptive of the peace wizarding society has spent so long building.</p>

<p class = "pseudo">Like with this whole business we are interested in disarranging musical experience.  The rooms in this house deliberately present no predetermined routes and, although some categorisation is necessary (and we had trouble with those shifting boundaries mind), we encourage visitors just to wander about at their leisure.  We like to think of this space as a junk shop with its wonderful irony, the wobbling displays of dusty paraphernalia that invite all sorts of wild speculations but no actual answers.  In this creative space (tongues firmly in cheeks) an album of music seems to be the musical equivalent of a jaunt through IKEA with its proscribed routes and insistent tale of beautiful homes.</p>
<p class = "pseudo">Nathaniel Mackey’s book <i>From A Broken Bottle Traces of Perfume Still Emanate</i> is a series of letters written to the Angel of Dust (Mackey, 2010) .  The writer, N., dizzily explores his own music making conflating instrumental improvisation and spoken conversation as if they were the same thing.  The letters, although they take the form of frequent communiqués to a friend, unhinge the flow of the story while distinguishing themselves as discrete objects that complete themselves on their telling.  One can dip in and out of the book without losing the thread.  This project attempts to affect a similar sensation: there is no end point or goal (Mackey’s book just stops abruptly) and narrative understanding is not something accrued but imminent to the moment.  Traversal will deepen the experience but the relation of microcosmic perception to synthetic macrocosmic narrative is not causal: the latter is not entirely constituted on the former.  Rather, the process is dialectical with each layer informing the growth of other in a similar cycle to our analysis of Assemblage Theory in <b><a class = "miscLink" id = "cartTag">Cartography</a></b>.</p>
<p class = "pseudo">The rooms deal with the dissolution of narrative and the very human impulse to order disparate events into coherent stories.  Here you can poke holes through photographs, dismembering them and exposing the fiction of their coherence.  Text documents are split into fragments to upend and reverse their arcs.  Star charts initially present some sort of unity but fade and reform if disturbed.  For these rooms we have focussed on semantic sound: voices, poetry and unaccompanied song.  Although all the rooms deal with words in some way, <b>Scatter</b> is the home of poetry, story and folk song.  The voices here present themselves perhaps in their entirety, their words snagging on the rough surfaces so that they stutter or allow other meanings to slip through the gaps.  Often, they are cut into pieces so that they develop an individual meaning of their own that depends on their fragmentary nature.  When they appear together, they echo and crowd the space although they also sometimes sing in unexpected harmony.  <a class = "miscLink" id = "lacTag">See <b>Section 3.1</b> for an in-depth explanation of the sampling mechanics.</a> </p>

<p>Exemplifying this ironic play of meaning is the semi-fictional band Gorillaz, a creation of Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett.  The interesting thing for us about the band is their (completely necessary) multi-media existence: it’s as if their paranoid non-existence has spilled over into a variety of psychotic attempts to persuade their fans of their materiality.  We all play along: the Gorillaz are obviously not a real band but this doesn’t stop their fans from following their Instagram accounts and talking about them as if they are real people.  This knowing disguise is a central part of our own mythology.  The ironic nature of identity is revealed through enactment, supposedly signifying one thing (a band releasing albums) while simultaneously figuring a multitude of other scenarios.</p>
<p>Part of the Gorillaz project is about imagining crazy new futures and backstories for the lead characters (not to mention the scandalous amount of retconning).  Imagining possible new futures and unravelling the tangles of stories that do not serve us is an effective way of rewriting our own present.  Producer Remi Kabaka Jr himself says that their latest project <i>Song Machine</i>, a disorganised slew of collaborative singles and short films, “May have an obtuse narrative arc […] you just keep going until you run out of ideas” (<i>Future Sounds</i>, 2020) and bandmember Russel Hobbs asserts that “Song Machine feeds on the unknown, runs on pure chaos” (Hobbs quoted by Reilly, 2020).  Fiction is a powerful tool especially in areas where certain people are inevitably cast in the same restrictive roles.  Sun Ra’s afro-futurist elucidations on space, the African Diaspora and alternative histories are hyperreal non-meanings that powerfully reimagine black folk as gods, aliens, angels, a highly articulate and technologically advanced species.  Janelle Monáe’s posthuman, android persona questions white heteronormative assumptions of black women by positioning herself as radically other, subverting natural and technological binaries by declaring that she only dates androids. </p>
<p>Joanna Demers’ work <i>Drone and Apocalypse</i> (Demers, 2015) engages with fictionalisation-as-historical-exploration through similar processes of artful falsity.  This book is a simultaneously a fictional exploration of a body of virtual work of an unknown artist and a musicological analysis of drone music and installation.  The work is not meant to deceive but to render the emotional and sensory language of music in a new setting with a suitable grammar.  Equally, Gorillaz are not meant to be understood as “real” musicians but as a stage for performing qualities of meaning that are inexpressible in regular old reality.  Access to “realistic” as a value is only possible through fictionalisation.</p>
<p>A writer who exemplifies this position is Saidiya Hartman.  “Critical Fabulation” is a term used by Hartman in Venus in Two Acts for the process of extending historical records into the terrain of the imagination in order to redefine historical figures outside of the limiting roles they were given (Hartman, 2008: 2-7).  Although it is important not to shy away from accounts of slavery and colonisation Hartman takes issue when this narrative becomes the only narrative: how can black Americans ever be free in white America when they are treated as slaves by conservative government and depicted as slaves by liberal/radical protestors.  This is not to forget the past – Hartman emphasises the “critical” in Critical Fabulation – but to expand the historical domain beyond slavery racist narratives and imagine happier and freer futures (Hartman, 2008: 11-13).  This process also overturns the conception of history as objective truth and instead exposes these accounts as fiction, not in the sense of falsehood, but in the sense of culturally constructed webs of meaning.  We have talked in <b><a class = "miscLink" id = "gathTag">Gather</a></b> about the ground/expression fallacy of bodies and we believe this concept to be another powerful intervention into this myth.  The historical archive should not be seen as an objective fact, free from discourse, but as much a narrative as fiction itself.  The fact that the archives only log the African diaspora in terms of slavery doesn’t mean that the diaspora was objectively limited to slavery but that the method of archiving was compromised.</p>
<p>Our fictive frame, The Dream Lens, and our fictional separation into Autumn and Hendra, pulls the dormant symbolic narrative out into the light of day.  Plainly showing the contingency of what was assumed to be given within the closed loops of heteronormative signification the lens allows a different approach to a reality not opposed to fiction, but itself made “realistic” through fiction.</p>
