<h1 class = "miscTitle">Gather – The Body and Discursive Subjectivity </h1>
<p class = "quote"><i>The voice isn’t necessarily individual; it belongs to a community, to a culture, to a society.</i>
-	Holly Herndon (McDermott, 2020)</p>
<p>A key theme in this project is focus on a critique of the idea of the body and biological sex as a foundation for cultural expression.  Judith Butler in Gender Trouble marks the compulsory order of sex/gender/desire as a problematic starting place for feminist politics, and by extension our project, owing to its stake in a pre-discursive existence of a body (Butler, 1990: 6).  In this logical formation there exists something that predates our current political context as a “citizen”, “criminal”, “Londoner”, that claims to have been consistent before these processes were enacted upon us: the body which will become a Londoner.  Butler argues against the causal/temporal logic of this prediscursive materiality by asserting that political subjects are formed by biological/medical/juridical discourses (Ibid.: 7).</p>
<p>Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst’s explorations into artificial intelligence (AI) touch on a few of these areas.  Herndon’s album Proto was written using an AI called “Spawn”, a neural network which was trained with samples and recordings of Herndon’s own work.  The issue with training AI, Herndon claims, is that AI is not very clever: it requires a human input and cannot learn without being provided with a curriculum, so to speak (McDermott: 2020).  Feeding the computer old work will simply result in “new” old work.  The body of work and the body of the AI are found in the same space which is defined both by Herndon’s code and the composition of data sets with which to feed the AI.  As Lisa Blackman explains, “the body is not bounded by the skin, where we understand the skin to be a kind of container for the self, but rather our bodies always extend and connect to other bodies, human and non-human, to practices, techniques, technologies and objects which produce different kinds of bodies” (Blackman, 2008: 1).  Herndon articulates her body of work by extending into a program that can articulate right back at you.</p>
<p>This eco-system complicates any notion of predetermined grounds for subjectivity through the self-reflexive closed loop of communication: human writes program, program writes human.  Both bodies are in the process of writing themselves: Herndon’s use of AI disrupts the notion of a natural ground through which subjectivity enacts its own existence.  The communication between Herndon and “Spawn” questions the very formation of a human subject by presenting to us a totally prescribed machine, something articulated at every turn, a process of becoming.  In Herndon’s own words, “AI is ultimately useless without us […] AI is just us, in aggregate” (McDermott: 2020).</p>
<p>This project attempts a similar process whereby the formation of a boy of work is discursively produced though interaction with a collection of processes.  According to Butler “Gender is […] the discursive/cultural means by which “sexed nature” or a “natural sex” is produced and established as “prediscursive”, prior to culture, a politically neutral surface on which culture acts” (emphasis original) (Butler, 1990: 7).  “Natural sex” should here be read as the given ground of musical expression and “gender” as the expression itself as bodies formed within this political discourse are invariably gendered.  By disrupting access to this ground, for instance a conclusive recording, this project makes clear these processes of contingent creative formation.  <b><a class = "miscLink" id = "cartTag">Cartography</a></b> will extend this concept and analyse the social and musical body of practicing musicians.</p>

<h2 class = "pseudo">Bodies of work</h2>
<p class = "pseudo">Who writes destinies of biological nature?  Walking through our home is an exercise in pulling together and rewriting.  A room here is an open sky dotted with stars.  The visitor is gently nudged to start drawing and very soon constellations start to appear.  What is initially an open scatter starts to mould itself to some sort of intelligible form.  Similarly, a room in which a text is presented has its consistency pulled apart when other texts start to force their way between the neat sentences.  What does it mean to “make sense” when other voices clamour and dissolve the syntax, short-circuiting two disparate assemblages so that they interfere with one another? </p>
<p class = "pseudo">This wing of the house is named <b>Gather</b> and it is here that we remember, reminisce, and form our thoughts.  We’re always surprised at how estranged the memories can be because, in the heat of nostalgia, the material softens, mixing with other memories.  In other places we may deal with stories and information but here we are fixated on objects and their myriad ways of propagating and intermingling.  Another word may be “taxonomy” and in the dark rooms we like to pore over star charts and chronologies of old kings and queens.  These destinies are malleable: “The very form of coalition, of an emerging and unpredictable assemblage of positions, cannot be figured in advance” (Butler, 1990: 14).  We bring these objects together, but it cannot really be said that they have any past consistency as the weaving itself allows us to pretend they were once singular.  </p>
<p class = "pseudo">The room with the shifting text is an excellent example, <a class = "miscLink" id = "lacTag">see the first part of section 3.4 for an example of this page embedded within the <b>Cartography</b> section</a>.  Here we have a nice poem or a bit of memory written down by one or other of us (Hendra goes in for these things more often that Autumn) that seems to make a certain sense but the arrival of other words unsettles this initial feeling.  The “original” text is itself a convergence of texts, a polyvocal ensemble, a collaboration between we, Hendra, Autumn and Joseph, and the readers.  Herndon’s opening insight that voices are communal expressions speaks of this collaborative generation of body and music (McDermott, 2020).</p>
<p class = "pseudo">We have made an effort to group the texts into categories and the Gather wing of work tends to be about history, lists of star names and the like but these categories are necessarily mushy.  The band Hen Ogledd work in a similar magical realist/taxonomical space which has somewhat paved the way for us.  Richard Dawson, singer and bassist, often sprinkles his work with album-spanning motifs – the apostles (<i>Nothing Important</i>, 2014), local memory (<i>The Magic Bridge</i>, 2011) – which appear like objects of renaissance symbolism to draw thin strands of recollection between otherwise disparate songs.  Hen Ogledd, which also comprises Rhodri Davies, Dawn Bothwell, Sally Pilkington, abstract this tendency by forming whole songs based on lists of Welsh words and scientific disciplines, Scottish kingdoms and angry letters to the council.  Lists and collections are inherently capable of being sub-categorised, rewritten, and cross-referenced and it is this mode of world-building that we, like Hen Ogledd, invoke in this setting (Hen Ogledd, 2018).</p>
<p class = "pseudo">Musically, we focus on organum and polyphony because it seems to us that extrapolating melodies and variations from a ground distends the original motif.  The melody exists in its raw form, and nothing seems more routed in tradition and the eternal than a cantus firmus, but the addition of voices derived from those notes draw out the latent and silent possibilities in the staid, non-metrical and strictly functional cantus.  Organum, to our ears, is a collective working out of a single idea in a multitude of perspectives.  </p>
<p class = "pseudo">Incidentally, the melody itself is written from your footsteps.  Each choice adds a degree, 0 to 6, to the browser’s memory meaning that each navigation lengthens and develops the saved melody.  This “neutral” dataset can be contorted and mapped to a selection of modes, chosen on page load, which distends the “original” melody but maintains its contours.  This intangible ground means nothing by itself and can only be actualised by its relation to a sister mode, the skeleton of melody is flexible and takes shape only through the actions of the visitor.  <a class = "miscLink" id = "lacTag"><b>Section 3.2</b> contains a thorough walkthrough of the code and functionality of this program.</a></p>
<p class = "pseudo">This body of work represents our tangible forms.  We come together in their coming together and are written in the combination and digression of the various places.  Previously we did not exist but are called into some form of materiality by the interplay of the forces at work here.  We disown the idea that we must exist materially before being able to express our nature as we have no nature and our expression is our material.</p>
