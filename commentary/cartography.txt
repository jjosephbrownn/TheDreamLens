<p class = "quote"><i>If my sixteen-year-old self’s tastes had been catered to fully by an algorithm on Spotify, I would be listening to the shittiest music. I needed interventions, that’s how you grow and get exposed to different things. We’re coddling people with algorithms. It’s depraved. </i> -  Holly Herndon (McDermott, 2020)</p>
<p>In the beginning pages of Gender Trouble Butler asks the question “who is the subject of feminism?” (Butler, 1990: 1).  Her argument is that, through preconceived understandings of identity and culture we have arrived at certain formulations that regenerate forms of gender and sexual oppression.  These maps of assumptions – the coherence of the categories of sex and gender for example – are inherited from patriarchal discourse and allow a blindness to the fact that disciplines as varied as biology, anthropology and philosophy are in fact products of certain ways of thinking.  Taking this further, we argue that music making is not exempt from this and that our current normal methods of musical expression – albums, singles, compilations, concerts – are also, in part, products of a patriarchal society.  In this section we examine the supposedly coherent category of “musician” and ask “who is the subject of music?”</p>

<h2>The Disorganised Musician</h2>
<p>The compulsory order of sex/gender/desire can be mapped onto music making in an interesting way.  Musicking, for Christopher Small, is the interaction between bodies and the outcome of a collective working out of ideas (Small, 1998: 9-12,40-42).  We agree with this but would like to position this decidedly non-capitalist formulation against a neo-liberal competing force which attempts to undermine this collectivised spirit with a process of providing “pre-musicked” subjects.  This dialectic is finely balanced:  Small is indeed right that music happens when bodies interact and that, in a sense, bodies happen when bodies interact but it must not be forgotten that music also happens to bodies in an Althusserian process of interpellation (Žižek, 2014: 62-64) .  Georgina Born observes that “music conjures up and animates imagined communities, aggregating its listeners into virtual collectivities and publics based on musical and other identifications” (Born, 2011: 378).  Autumn has callused fingers from guitar playing and Hendra old burns from soldering irons.  Musicians are formed and sculpted by music, whether that music is happening as an active, communal project or not.  Redirect to <b><a class = "miscLink id = "gathTag">Gather</a></b> for a more fundamental discussion on the formations of individual bodies.</p>
<p>Deleuze and Guattari’s theory of assemblages is useful here.  An assemblage of musicians is made up of units that are infinitely connective.  There is no ground to these units – a person is an assemblage of interacting parts (DeLanda, 2016: 1-7).  This extends Small’s theory in an interesting way as the group must describe the body of the musician and its confluence with instrument and environment.  Any assemblage is therefore an assemblage of assemblages which expresses emergent properties depending on the interaction of its constituents.  These can interact at any level: between people but also between instruments, between sub-assemblages.  Born also makes this connection with Deleuze and Guattari: “Music requires and stimulates associations between a diverse range of subjects and objects – between musician and instrument, composer and score, listener and sound system, music programmer and digital code” (Born, 2011: 377).  This open model which nicely describes Small’s own theory is not just temporary but can pass on traits to later assemblages as the participating musicians learn bad habits or take with them bad experiences.  </p<
<p>Within this deleuzian paradigm the <b><a class = "miscLink" id = "cartTag">Cartography</a></b> pages present collections of ideas and names that are to be actively rerouted.  Certain structures are presented, a section of text or image, which are quickly disassembled and rearranged.  Collections of star names, prehistoric sites and areas of London can be interrupted and dispersed by the user who is invited at points to input their own place names or categories or memories.  “Finsbury Park, Tottenham Hale, Bethnal Green, Morpeth, Inverness, Zagreb” was something that happened to us during testing.  Londoning may only happen as a communal effort on the part of all Londoners but so also must Tottenhaming, and Bethnal Greening.</p>
<p>However, assemblages are subject to territorialisations, prescription of their functions, which limit their free-form activity and start to define the members in strict roles.  Although the practice of making music may be social, it is interesting to remember that, in an orchestra, we still have roles that come with some social capital “first violin”, “conductor” etc (Blackman, 2008: 61-64).  Lisa Blackman links this explicitly to “bodily dispositions” pointing to how this kind of capital is inscribed on and within the body: “Social, symbolic and cultural forms of capital are acquired, learnt and formed through social practices such as education and schooling and can be used as cultural resources to position and be positioned within social relationships” (Blackman, 2008: 62).  Musicking can be turned around and used to minutely identify determinate subject positions through marking bodies socially, instrumentally, or linguistically.  </p>
<p>Tricia Rose in <i>What We Talk About When We Talk About Hip-Hop</i> describes the ways hip hop has been commercialised and sold to white audiences as a cartoonish ideal of blackness in the white imagination (Rose, 2008: 3-6).  Musicking may be a community expression and a process of joining bodies together but placed within the consumer economy its powers of connection and group articulation are complicit in maintaining oppressive distinctions such as “blackness” or “masculinity” and “class”.</p>
<p>This has implications for our own project as we attempt to undo some of the discourse around bodies and identity.  To return to Herndon briefly, one of the issues she identifies with AI is the data that is used to teach it – an excellent example is the plethora of twitter bots that have been taught by online trolls to become hate-spewing racist machines.  Herndon uses only material written for the project at hand so that the AI is composing “up to date”, rather than “old”, Herndon music (McDermott, 2020).  We ourselves have identified some of these patriarchal processes that have previously shaped our practice – the cult of the guitar hero, the obsession with musical lineage, the focus on identity and genius – and have attempted to subvert these powers by displacing our own creativity into an aleatoric labyrinth, by creating a web of fiction around ourselves and even by completely inventing our whole existence.  <b><a class="miscLink" id="scatTag">Scatter</a></b> will analyse these fictional illusions in greater detail.</p>
<p>Judith Butler backs us up here by describing gender as a temporality, as a performance that requires time and duration to actualise the shifting signification of what it means to do gender (Butler, 1990: 137-141).  We like this idea because it removes univocal agency from music making and instead highlights the relational aspect and the community building facets of making music.  Music isn’t, and never was, the expression of a person but neither must we assume the determinate nature of musicians musicking.  Small’s theory, in a way, doesn’t go far enough and misses the dis-organised nature of musicking.</p>

<h2>The Tale of the Body</h2>
<p>This puts us in mind of musical instruments.  The body of a guitar is always resonant, never at rest.  Music is not so much ordering the body of the guitar (has anyone noticed that the study of musical instruments, the taxonomy and phylogenetics, is called “organology”?), inscribing on it the nomenclature of whatever tradition to you happen to be part of, but letting the machine work with your body, combining assemblages, pooling resources and sharing information, coaxing the latent sound out of the thing and yourself.  Music here isn’t predicated on a resonating body – we all assume it already exists and the manner of its appearance is beautiful in its particularity, but not confined solely to that context.  It certainly isn’t a body of knowledge, already founded, that is applied to an instrument.</p>
<p?Lee “Scratch” Perry’s music enacts some of this groundless reorganisation through his reworkings of reggae recordings.  The reuse of already organised material breaks apart that spurious unity and shows us both the flimsiness of the old illusion of unity but also the beauty of the new illusion (Corbett, 1994: 126-135).  When we listen to dub we hear the newly disparate nature of the original material and the inconsistencies latent in those initial relationships made visible by their unwinding.  This schema, for Perry, goes beyond the territory of sonic cartography where the limits of the strictly regulated human body are undun by the reciprocal haptic cycles of the relationships between musicians and musical objects: “he self-identified as “a machine being” […] not so much wired into the desk as indistinguishable from it” (Harries, 2015: 47).  Donna Haraway similarly, in A Cyborg Manifesto, highlights the way that the imagination of a posthuman body, a conversation of flesh and machine, can show us that we are already a process of extension and alteration (Haraway, 2016: 9-13).  These dreams of disruption and reorganisation are not the future but the present – humans already are posthuman and always have been as we weave ourselves around instruments and rhythms.  Extending Small again, musicking is the process of being a musician, of becoming-musician, whether connecting to an assemblage of musicians or conversing with the various components of private music making. </p>

<h2 class = "pseudo">Maps and Legends</h2>
<p class = "pseudo">Submerged patterns make an appearance in the work of Paul Gilroy who asserts that “routes” are also “roots”: the African diaspora, for example, found a cultural expression through transnationality and double consciousness (Gilroy, 1993: 15-16).  Pathfinding and the rebuilding of assemblages reinvigorates and recontextualises previous cultural practices while also becoming a site of resistance to the very powers that affected these changes.</p>
<p class = "pseudo">The improvisation group Viridian focus on this overlaying of intelligible signs in their multi-media performances (2018).  Using acoustic instruments alongside film projectors and modular synths the group attempt to map their own routes through a semi-fictionalised environment.  The clips are created in the days leading up to a performance and feature local landscapes and streets, these reels being included alongside the growing library of material from previous performances.  The dual projectors overlay these scenes on a single screen while the projectionists are left free to curate the images.  Optical sound recorded at the time of filming is outputted into modular synths as control voltages which, in our opinion, beautifully combines the various sensory and imaginary materials.  </p>
<p class = "pseudo">The <b>Cartography</b> rooms are explorations of these sorts of webs of meanings that lie latent in music making and that need to be excavated.  The rooms here focus more on reworking premade patterns and systems to see how far they bend before breaking.  In one room a blank page hides fragments of text that appear when hovered over, only to disappear quickly.  Another room presents text fragments in a non-linear order, one paragraph at a time, that appear when scrolled through.  It is unclear whether these parts are in the correct order.  Constellations are presented with names defining them but after a bit of tugging and twisting the name seems to have changed to something else.</p>
<p class = "pseudo">The primary music engine in these rooms utilises a Lindenmayer-system in order to generate melodies.  An L-system is a parallel writing system that makes sentences by analysing a grammar and applying rules to it.  <a class = "miscLink" id = "lacTag"><b>Section 3.4</b> goes into some detail concerning the maths of the Lindenmayer system.</a>  Briefly, the algorithm can be used to make melodies by interpreting the string as a set of counterpoint rules.  Emerging from this primary pattern are myriad other forms that are expressive of their original context.</p<
<p class = "pseudo">In turn we have offered some roots of our own and used materials that, when turned this way and that, offer a multitude of different implications: double exposure photos, sections of old maps, pages from <i>The Book of Fixed Stars</i> by Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi.  There is indeed some kind of unity here, but it is shifting and is refocussed by the activity of the visitor.  Neither we nor they are entirely predefined but the navigation through this conversation subtly reconstructs our musical body.</p>
