<h1>Repurpose – Nature and Technology</h1>
<p><i>In the traditions of “Western” science and politics […] the relation between organism and machine has been a border war. The stakes in the border war have been the territories of production, reproduction, and imagination. </i>
-	Donna Haraway (Haraway, 2016: 7)</p>
<p>Understanding the body as a confluence of poetry and narrative without factoring in technology takes some effort.  Rather than seeing technology as a tool for building we prefer Martin Heidegger’s perspective that technology is a horizon of thinking (Žižek, 2014: 94).  In other words, technology is the mode through which we understand the world.  However, it is almost too easy to assume that our lives are now completely technology based that our brains have been rewired and that we are made entirely out of code.  In this section we would like to explore some of the uncomfortable exclusions that the project has inherited from technological discourses. </p>

<h2>Nature and Technology Estranged</h2>
<p>Although we agree with Donna Haraway’s argument that modern feminism must embrace changes in the body through technology in order to outgrow the standard patriarchal binary “nature/technology” (Blackman, 2008: 109) we would also like to stress the importance of her later analysis that focusses on the exclusions that capitalist technology enacts (Haraway, 2016: 37-40).  The “disclosure of being” of technology must also come with the qualification that not all these fantastical revelations are positive.  Indeed, the server farms that support our home network are often to be found in places of low rent, outside the UK, where local populations can be extorted to provide the services required or to put up with the ensuing pollution.  Furthermore, digital access assumes that the visitor is able-bodied, technologically literate wealthy enough to afford the required devices.  The internet is not built with dyslexia, dyspraxia, attention disorders and visual or auditory impairment in mind.  We mention these qualifications because we do not intend to present our discussion of digital futures as inevitably favouring able-bodied post-humans that display our inbuilt phobia of disability and our ever-present fetishization of fitness.  </p>
<p>To return to the binary nature/technology and to draw out some of these contradictions we would like to turn to some of our favourite books: <i>Mythago Wood</i> and <i>Lavondyss</i> by Robert Holdstock.  In these novels an area of primary woodland left forgotten near Gloucester starts to exert its influence on the characters within the story.  In the former book, Steven returns home and, after a series of hauntings and unexpected encounters, it is revealed that Steven’s father was mapping vortices of power that seemed to emanate from the oak thickets.  These currents can awaken ancient parts of the human brain, the “mytho-poetic zones” that are the centres of imagination, specifically the imagination of heroes, demons and other mythic characters and forces (Holdstock, 1984).  In <i>Lavondyss</i> Tallis Keeton ventures far into the heartwoods and is subsumed by its fractal maze, taking on the form of a Neolithic archetype that transcends time, only to be spat out once again in her own time, a snake that eats its own tail or, in this case, tale (Holdstock, 1988).</p>
<p>It is in this sense that we intend to think of our current disclosure of being, whether you call that “nature” or “technology”: something that has gone so far that its return makes it seem a ghost.  Slavoj Žižek, in discussing Heidegger, calls technology the ontological ground of our current humanity that allows us to have a separate sphere called “nature” (and to exploit it ruthlessly).  “Nature” is entirely mediated by “culture” (Žižek, 2014: 94, 205).  This was the main takeaway from Björk’s album, and app, Biophilia (2011) which merged environmental themes with technological prowess and artistry.  For us, very fact that the two spheres (nature: global warming, pollution, loss of natural resources; technology: app development, user interaction, the lush live shows) were so profoundly interlinked revealed the hypocrisy of their separation.  The fact that our knowledge of the natural world is unavoidably mediated by technology in the form of microscopes, telescopes and satellites has not been lost on Björk.  Playing with the app narrates this mediation and clearly shows that we can only know of “nature” through “technology”.  The end effect is a weird reflexivity: the world understanding a piece of itself through itself.</p>
<p>Within the same breath we must mention Arca whose hybrid-technological cosmology has sent disruptive tremors through adjoining realities.  Variously combined with robotic limbs (‘Reverie’, 2017) and strapped onto a car and covered in cattle milking tech (‘@@@@@’, 2020) Arca eloquently articulates the posthuman nature of queers in heteronormative society.  Excluded members of society such as Arca (a non-binary trans-woman) are always placed within this kind of technological ontology, which is already figured as deviant, unnatural, prosthetic, or unnecessary.  This daring posthuman appearance again requires a rethinking of human bodies as “natural” and challenges, through refiguring familiar signs and objects, what Haraway describes as “inherited thinking” (Blackman, 2008: 109).  This is a very hypocritical politics: the ability to condemn Arca’s representation of posthuman bodies as “unnatural” is only made possible by a technological ontology that is uniquely capable of distinguishing between “natural” and “technological”.</p>
<p>This convolution of creeper and speaker wire reminds us of our brief analysis of Lee “Scratch” Perry’s identification as “machine-being”, a patch-bay-brain (Harries, 2015: 47) in <b><a class ="miscLink" id = "cartTag">Cartography</a></b>.  The manipulation of sonic fragments is imagined by Perry as an essential becoming of his existence, an escape from the abject and incomplete form of humanity, “A pointless and treacherous category” (Kodwo Eshun quoted in Harries, 2015: 44), sundered from its powerful potential by the very distinction of the restrictive, white-supremacist “nature” and a denatured, inhuman technology.</p>
<p>Somewhere in between Björk and Arca’s flawed post-humanity and Scratch’s visionary transcendentalism is the quiet, minute world of the sound recordist Chris Watson and the electro-acoustic composer Hildegard Westerkamp.  The former’s work is both a capturing of sonic events, an archive of curiosities and hard-to-find rarities and an interrogation of the very technological mediation of these events.  Watson buries microphones in glaciers (‘Vatnajkull’, 2003) or the carcases of animals (‘Cracking Viscera’, 1998) to open new landscapes of aural knowledge which requires the listener to confront the very origins of the recordings.  Westerkamp removes some of this ambiguity by telling us about the equipment she used to record limpets and barnacles while also ironically romanticising the hidden life of these beach lifeforms (‘Kits Beach Soundwalk’, 1989).  Our material reality is stretched beyond our body by these prosthetic ears that gift us with superhuman hearing that questions the usual assumptions of aural contexts from which human presence has been erased by setting up situations that could never have been witnessed in our regular aural reality.</p>

<h2 class = "pseudo">The Dream Lens and Technological Mediation</h2>
<p>Visitors to this place where we are not “tied to the seasons” (Holdstock, 1984: 212) might experience something similar.  These are not stable places but rooms of learning and exploration which allow processes of enmeshing and reciprocation rather than passive consumption.  This digital zone, containing as it does the inherent exclusions described above, negates ideas of completeness and organic perfection.  Here we find our well-travelled mechanisms - the melodies, words and choices - that have circulated so far from us in the symbolic economy that we barely recognise them.  Blank canvases outlined only with a randomly chosen title ask the visitor to leave their own thoughts in the hope that they might take on a life of their own.  The browser here listens to the keystrokes and, if the visitor chances to pass by this way again, they may notice some of their work adorning the walls.  <u class = "appLink">See <b>Section 2.3.1</b> and <b>2.3.2</b> for an explanation of these machines.</u>  Other texts change before the author’s eyes and words they never wrote are quietly inserted.  Pictures fade and blend with other, less familiar landscapes while distant voices slowly begin to appear.</p>
<p><b>Repurpose</b> focusses on musical samples and sound recordings.  We found that they had no life of their own and so we hope that a visitor might make more sense out of these serendipitous encounters.  As Arca refigures the queer body as technologically beautiful, exposing the narrative of queers in heteronormative space as unnaturally altered, we refigure music, the natural world and the experience of these spheres as inherently technological.  Technology is the lens through which we dream.  The camera used to capture the images used is an old Russian manual with no automatic film advance.  The resulting double exposure and half photos describe the technological mediation of nature perfectly, hence “Dream Lens”.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this site is imperfect, difficult to use and frustratingly obscure (Mum, 2020).  The virtual dream, the transcendence of humanity into a cyber sphere, is a fantasy of “Silicon Fascists” to use Zola Jesus’ (2019) term for those who believe that nature can be overcome by human will and ingenuity.  The inadequate nature of our site opposes the technological perfectionism that plays too easily with eugenicist ideals.  The tech/nature binary requires technology to be perfect, belying the fact that the very same technology often fails spectacularly and asks more questions than it answers.  This failure is, for us, the key to deconstructing the war against nature that technology wages – it shows us that the domain of science is also incomplete and cannot fully explain the human experience, exemplified in the fact that it must constantly define itself against something dark and prerational.  Mistakes and holes in understanding are key to the effectiveness of the project as they reveal the deficiencies of the ontological lens.  Just as Holdstock’s creatures display the flaws and ideals of the individuals who imagined them, our merging with technological environments fashion themselves around us and reflect our own natures.</p>
<p>This failure is a central component of Judith Halberstam’s queer theory in <i>The Queer art of Failure</i>.  If heteronormativity is understood as a demand for flawlessness through enlightenment and rationality then queerness can only be failure in the sense of a deficient mode of hetero-perfection (Halberstam, 2011: 87-91).  By resisting the straightening of societies queers are forced to accept failure, in careers, familial expectations and, frequently, in health and personal finances.  We would like to understand Arca, and the loosening of the tech/nature binary, in this light: if what Arca shows us is a posthuman queer then that queer must also be something of a failure prone to short-circuits and crashing.  This unstable cyborg hybrid is at once a monstrosity of a mirror-image of straightness, of the work queers do to fit in, to add to their bodies in order to be normal (Blackman, 2008: 61-63) and a joyous embrace of “unnatural” technology banned from straight life.  This fluidity allows us to think beyond the designation “tech/nature”.  The cold binary is an emblem of the success of heteronormativity in its battle to keep the irrational at bay but the failures and experiments of the artists we have discussed here, as well as the wonky, DIY nature of our own project, destabilise this separation and communicate a way of viewing queerness bodies beyond states of nature.</p>
