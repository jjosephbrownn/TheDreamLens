`<h1>Histories iii: imaginary bodies</h1>
<p>we are prone to recollection, to nostalgia and to memorial.  Histories, however tend to be histories of events, mind or thoughts.  They are stories of cliché and constellations of opinion put into actions and outcomes.  The history of slavery is recounted as something that happened, not as something that was thought, planned, as if the actors were just caught up in the currents.  Sometimes these stories are stained by the efforts of the sensory characters – the cruel victimization by Thatcher after the Hillsborough disaster spreading like water damage over the pristine narrative of a natural tragedy.  History is written by the winners and the prize is the opportunity to pretend that they are not fictionalizing, the honour of enshrining their fabulation as natural causality.What about histories of bodies? </p>
<p> “What about the Kingdom of Strathclyde? Where was the elegy for those ones written out of history for being angry and forgotten?” (Hen Ogledd, <i>transport and travel</i>).</p>
<p>This body of water is calm and still but can be whipped up at any moment into a fury, to slop into our tent.  What of the foundational moments that bind the bodies together?  What is the nature of the substances that negotiate the boundaries between limbs and departments?</p>
<p>A group of us sit in the park, warm tins of beer, sheltering from the cold – a London summer.  We listen to the friends we sort of know, they’re not our friends as such but they are definitely friends, someone’s friends, enough to be labelled by their relationships.  The are talking of tumultuous times, late nights and earl shifts, walking through shacklewell finishing off the beer that will get you through the day.  This is the tremor they felt, the series of sliding tales that weave the fabric that clothes them all.  They may yet, or have been, friends of a different sort but this is their home, this structure of funny drunk stories and echoes of hangovers.  The staff body was formed in advance and they were fitted in, but they burst its boundaries and rewrote that script.  This script remains a script, mind.  A palimpsest, postscripts and notes dashed in the margins or squeezed between lines, whole sentences rewritten, scenes deleted, but the pages remain and to an extent the channel is unchanged.</p>
<p>If these are as shaky as they seem, as reliant on loving investment as a favourite novel then where does that leave our official histories?  If our bodies are as irreversibly scripted as this then it follows that we must be wholly reliant on the histories of our spaces and our childhoods.  Writing these things in stone and burying might let them be discoverable but it doesn’t make them true, they are still fabrications.  We swallow these stories of brave Britain, the plucky abolitionists, the merchant adventurers, and the loveable rogues of the East India Company because they are authoritative but we discard our holy late night stories because of an uneasy feeling that they might be unhealthy. </p>
<p>Art and history are peer-reviewed, they must past a teste before they are allowed to be art/history.  In the pending period of their existence they are merely craft and story.  Stories, narratives and accounts are to be quality controlled before they can be a history of this nation.</p>
<p>It looks like we’ll have to rewrite, redraw and contextualise our stories then.  Its uncomfortable but we are here today because of slavery, colonial territorialisation, the suppression of voting, the windrush scandal.  If we stay silent then we let these stories define us, we are cast as complicit and the world carries on turning.  Saidiya Hartman stresses the importance of fabulation, fictionalization, of history not only to recast the stories of slaves condemned to either the role of structuring our racist society or the dubious, definitive foundation of blacks as solely descendants of slaves, property, commodities that washes away any modern sense of agency or culture, but to expose official history itself as fictional.  There is no substantive difference, history has always been story that has gone through a process of ossification.</p>
<p>“I am not my body, I am somebody” sings Rakel Mjöll of Dream Wife.  A body of literature does not have to define us, an official body administrates only by assumed consent.  Although Mjöll is asserting her humanity over her physical appearance I think she is also saying that she is not the body (of stories, of water, of discrete data entries) that is spoken for by power, but that she is some body, some things but not others, some of this and some of that, something that cannot be spoken for but that must be spoken at all times, in the same way that our friends from earlier must speak and re-speak their stories as a recollection that re-embodiment and reaffirms their friendship whilst also performing their body of work to new friends who would know them.  Whether we like it or not bodies are always bodies of literature but we have the power to retire certain texts that do not speak for us.  As electronic ghosts, we the writers are required to reassess our position in the chain of technology and writing that has defined us and to expose those as fictions lest they continue to define us still.  We are documents of racism and colonialism as sure as we are documents of HTML and JavaScript.  These latter may be strictly determinate, but we are machines; England is not and retains the privilege of altering its source code.</p>
<p>And again, what about the Kingdom of Strathclyde?</p>`
