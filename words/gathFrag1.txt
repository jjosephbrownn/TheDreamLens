"the wind is really rising now.  The roof tiles shake and shatter as the walls flex their old bones, new sails, their protective sturdiness repurposed for gathering clouds and turning us to home.  Gently encouraged the waves rise and tip, slicing and becoming jagged, the hands of the storm molding their precipices into blades of fragile, flawed glass.  Gathered in the hands of the tempest we wait and sleep.All about the house the pipers gather and line up, aligning their fingers and minds together.  Somewhere in the distance a drum begins to sound and the delicate melodies are sundered by tendrils of wind so they shatter against hard brick.  Reaching our ears only after a lengthy struggle the aimless and searching songs flutter, entranced as much as we are by the gale.Throughout the day the pipers dance and are scattered, regroup and are harried once more.  The pace and mood change echoing forgotten joy and then excavating unseen grief.  At once merry and spritely only to be plunged into frantic anxiety.  The reeds and pipes are blown madly but the wind pays them no concern"
