`<h1>Histories ii</h1>
<h2>Written by Autumn Andersen</h2>
<p>We were waiting patiently at Harringay Green Lanes station for a train that would take us west towards Gospel Oak.  This station is about two stories above the ground and we looked over the rooftops that faded away from the narrow artery that is Green Lanes – an unusually sylvan name for a busy and polluted road, old fashioned and ill-suited for modern London.  As we walked up the ramp to the platform, we passed a short, round black man long braids sitting on those shiny metal benches which seem to have been designed for anything other than sitting comfortably.  He smiled at us and we passed on.  This line is beautiful because you can see all the way down on the eastern side.  Trains appear as pinpricks and slowly get larger and larger.  As the train pulled in and the doors started to open the man with the braids came up to us and said that we had such a visible and beautiful energy between us and that we should come and sit with him.  We did and he started to talk about Lovers Rock, and classic Jamaican pop music.  Coincidentally I had been reading about Lee “Scratch Perry, Sun Ra and George Clinton in John Corbett’s excellent book <i>Extended Play; Sounding Off from John Cage to Dr Funkenstein</i> and the way this man talked put me in mind of those characters – prophetic, deeply knowing but also playful and joyful, taking delight in word play and jokes.  </p>
<p>He enumerated a cosmology of love, histories of reggae singers and the afro-Caribbean lifeblood of London.  He also sang some songs to us, his two-person audience.  We sang along a bit (he rattled out some classics) but our reedy, choked voices couldn’t compete with his warm baritone.  He got off at Upper Holloway.  I still remember his total self-assurance and deft syllables, by talking he could create a universe.</p>`,
