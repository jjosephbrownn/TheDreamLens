`<h1>Lost and Found and Lost again</h1>
<p>I went home for the weekend, leaving London behind.  It didn’t notice, two more now-London boys moving over its sprawling body.</p>
<p>We spend a bit of time in the spaces between bodies as we are taken speeding across fields and rivers.  When we arrive the sleepy, creaking body of our home town stirs and finds us waiting on the platform.  We cause a bit of a stir, two boys down from London in their colourful shoes, second-shirts, band t-shirts and unusual hair styles.  This is odd as we never really left.  Spat out and returned in a damaged state.  Almost immediately I see someone I know.</p>
<p>We came home to clear out our old stuff.  It does accumulate.</p>
<p>Arms deep in forgotten curios and items that caught our interest then but now are dull with fatigue and starved of attention.  A few hours of sorting through the boxes of randomly collected junk I lose sense of time as I immerse myself in the multiplicity of spent time, slivers of thoughts, fragments of memories and threads of stories which wound themselves into complicated knots too quickly.  Strange currents and zephyrs are detected below the surface of dust and the ceramics made in childhood pottery classes, letters from friends and bar mats shift uneasily under my hands, uncomfortable.  Details and sub-plots of forgotten stories emerge.  I meet a friend in Bath for the day and in my pocket is a hand-drawn map of good places to visit courtesy of my mum.  On stage I pick out the chords to a hastily written song that I wrote yesterday to fill in the gap made by a member of the awkward company of friends leaving amidst rows over commitment, the extra page of scruffy jokes and chords fitting smugly amongst its type-written companions.</p>
<p>A small wooden owl, another owl made of a single, smooth bit of clay in the resemblance of a weathered stone from the beach (here the waves crash against the shingle of a very different beach where I am sat in the shade of a giant rotting groyne drawing faces on the stones around me) and a china cat curled up in swirls of deep indigo perform a variety of amusing tableaux for a gloomy afternoon’s entertainment.</p>
<p>I put them away in their new boxes on which are written their new use: “charity”, “hardcore waste”, “small appliances”, “cardboard”.</p>
<p.Some are too beautiful and the grim exteriors we had assumed to get through this task slip momentarily and each small item of curiosity is appraised and slipped into a nook somewhere, amongst the other fading talismans this house seems to collect.</p>
<p>Mum is in tears as my brother grimly tears up a sketch book full of fifteen year old doodles into piles for paper, cardboard and waste.</p>
<p>The fragments play across the surface of my memory and I send a few messages to friends with pictures from out of our past, strangely preserved in material form.  They leave my hands then and are reluctant to come back.  Everything is quietly resigned as I consign elements to their respective places. I am losing these memories even as I find them.  I really think they were happy in their dark corners.</p>
<p>I return to London the next evening.  No one noticed my absence or that my footprints are shallower than when I left.</p>`
