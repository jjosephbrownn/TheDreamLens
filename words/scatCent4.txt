`<h1>Extract from <i>Hard Times for Gaston Beaujolais</i></h1>
<h2>Written by Leonard Lexington</h2>
<p>Reg had been missing for two weeks.  He had last been seen pushing whiskies down his neck at Old Al’s bar on 46th keeping a couple of down-at-heel saps under his thumb whilst holding court over anyone who could be bothered to listen.  Reg was like that: raved and stuttered until the shadows drew in and the world bowed its shoulders under the weight of his wondering paranoia.</p>  
<p>This evening was no different, empty eyes gazed at him as if they saw some meaning amongst the junk and litter, mouths hung open as his words slurred into one another to hold themselves upright.  With a trembling left hand that still clutched a cracked glass of Al’s finest pulled up his right sleeve to his elbow exposing white scars and jewellery ruined by decay and filigree.  The watery eyes of Al’s other guests followed this movement as if they followed the carefully choreographed steps in a ballet where every step might coyly let slip a sliver of truth. </p> 
<p>No one was ever sure if Reg was genuinely insane or if his ravings were an act, a game to play to pass the time in these dust soaked streets.  In any case he was gone and, with no one to fill the void with ceaseless mumblings, everyone who might have known him or remembered him had been swallowed up.</p>
<p>But wherever he was Reg seemed to be panting yet, garbling schemes and escapades as if he were standing next to me.  I had noted Reg’s absence with little interest.  He was a local character who I knew by deed if not by worth.  I was therefore somewhat surprised to find a piece of paper in my hand written by Reg and unquestionably genuine.  The window of my small apartment looked out onto the busy thoroughfare of 32nd and I had been watching the smart-suited men saunter away four floors below when my eye fell onto the scrap of paper wedged into my window frame.  I could not have seen it from my chair or bed as the curtains covered this part of the wooden frame.  I had no memory of putting it there and, once I had read it, had no recollection of Reg ever visiting my rooms.  How had it got there?  I took it over to my desk to read and saw this message:</p>

<p><i>Follow the man with no thumbs.  1748, coffee with no milk, Aladdin.</i></p>
<p>I did not pretend to know what it meant.  <i>Aladdin?</i> Ramblings of a madman no doubt although made rather more disturbing by finding its way into my window.  Someone must have put it there but the only person to have entered recently was my landlord and he had neither the wit nor the humour to do such a thing.  Gaston had been by the previous week to pace up and down and mutter only to disappear again.  As I thought about it Gaston had been mysteriously taciturn about that visit, going so far as to keep himself holed up on his garret the other side of the river.  Then there was Francesca but she also had been somewhat recalcitrant and her handwriting was elegant and refined, far removed from this hasty, sloppy scrawl.
   <p> I descended from my apartment to the phone on the street to call Gaston.  He rarely answered his phone which I found infinitely frustrating as he was one of the few people I knew to own one.  This time, however, I was fortunate enough to reach him although I believe he thought I was someone else.</p><br>
  “Yes?” he demanded down the handset, breathing an abundance of air down his long nose. <br>
  “Gaston it’s me...”<br>
  “What? Oh, right.  Well...”</p>
<p>I knew he was about to make an excuse to put the phone down.  His mind worked on so many levels at once that I never seemed to catch him at a time that he needed me.  I had to wait whilst he mentally scheduled our relationship into the correct hemisphere of his thoughts.</p>
  <p>“Gaston” I interrupted “I found a note stuck in my window mentioning something about coffee and men with no fingers...”<br>
  “No thumbs.” He said briskly<br>
  “Excuse me?”<br>
  “No thumbs” he repeated.  “The man has no thumbs but is still in ownership of all his fingers, at least as far as I am aware.  Last time I saw ‘em they were all there”<br>
  “So you do know something about this?  I had quite a severe shock you know”<br>
  “Of course I know about this, I put the note there.  Dammit I thought you would have found it sooner than this morning!”<br>
  “You put it there? Why? This is utterly confusing, what are you talking about?”<br>
  “Look, it’s from Reg.  You see that mark in the bottom right corner?  He has a tattoo of the same design adorning his right shoulder.  It a lotus flower I believe.  No idea why he decided upon that hippy-shit design”</p>
  <p>I glanced down at the paper that I was still holding in my hand.  There was indeed a lotus flower in the right corner although the paper was so stained and dirty that I had assumed it was just another blot of filth.  In the light of day it also became plain to me that the paper was unusually fibrous and thick.</p>
  <p>“I have to go” barked Gaston unexpectedly. “I have been following the trail for a few days now and I left that note for you to find.  Admittedly I hid it so that you wouldn’t come prancing in too soon.  These things require a touch of delicacy that I am afraid you do no possess.”</p>
  <p>Even as the tide of outrage at being treated so unfairly gathered its resources Gaston had continued:<br>
  “There’s a diner round the corner from my apartment.  Be there tonight at 8” to which he put the phone down.
  A breath of wind wound its fingers around the casing of the phone booth, tugging at the hem of my coat and the ragged edges if the note.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Gaston was fretting, folding and refolding a paper napkin between his hands until the messy repetitions and revisions of a single lotus flower were hardly visible.  Gritty light filtered through the window that, although sufficiently highlighting the coffee stains and grease on the table top did nothing to lighten Gaston’s mood.  Steam caressed the glass leaving a shadow of condensation through which only the outlines of passing suits could be glimpsed.</p>
  <p>The smell of cold coffee and frying grated on Gaston’s fragile senses, running unforgiving hands down his spine, plucking delicate strings deep in his confused mind.  The sunlight, although paltry and anaemic sent shards of pain into the back of his skull, scouring the depths of his memory through plumes of grime.  Sweat beaded on his forehead as he sat hunched over a mug of coffee and he shivered involuntarily as the opening door sent a draft to harry his already fevered body.  He needed sleep and after that a bath, but he couldn’t go home right now.  He must wait at least another couple of hours before it was safe to re-enter his much neglected apartment.  He was sure he hadn’t been seen but it was always prudent to exercise a little caution when dealing with these kinds of people.</p>
  <p>Tiredness was not the entire problem.  Rumour had it that Larry Carmichael’s gang of small time thugs had switched from operating a modest yet lucrative intimidation business to racketeering, smuggling and distribution.  Gaston was not sure what they were distributing as his source had at that point collapsed in a drunken stupor and, as his presence was somewhat suspicious in that particular dive bar, he’d had to make his retreat.  However, the rambling drunk had let slip several times, each time accompanied with a plea for silence, the word “Aladdin” which had meant nothing to the erstwhile investigator.  The whole thing had seemed tangled, confused and ultimately mundane.  So what if some criminals had redecorated and smartened up?  At least this was what Gaston had thought last week after tripping out of the drinking hole but that was before he had learnt of Reg’s disappearance.  As unreliable and uncontained as Reg had become it seemed unlikely that he had simply vanished especially as he had been expected at a meeting of two of the city’s brightest criminal minds last week on October 24th one of whom was Reg’s uncle Cotton.  Gaston had learnt this from a contact low down in Cotton’s organisation and was thus the last to be admitted into the club of the fully clued up for which he was distinctly aggrieved.  Gaston liked his information, if not hot off the press, then cooling on the windowsill where he could steal it and rewarm it in private.</p>`
