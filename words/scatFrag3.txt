Finishing about now is the final, languishing roll of the wheel.  Ceaseless has been its activity until this moment which signals the beginning of the loss of control, the start of the ebb of energy and the ever more frequent stuttering and creaking accompanied by other sounds of mechanical wear and tear.  
These things can’t be maintained for ever.  There must be at least a small amount of energy flowing into a system such as this but now it seems that this source has long since dried up.  Things went all peacefully for a while, the momentum of success drawing the reserves of power up from the dry tanks and hoppers where such substances are stored.  Now the last dregs have gone and the dance has become distinctly lacklustre.  
I have often wondered why my mind pretty much invariably jumps to either mechanical or “natural” metaphors when sifting around in the dusty excess of experience and lyrical raw material.  These two things seem strangely at odds, polarised maybe.  But if we are good at anything it is at drawing false distinctions where actually there exists only a semblance or none at all.  These poles collapse into one and are absorbed into the mess of symbolism while any actually polarised material is found sitting at the bottom of the sludge waiting for us to take notice.  
It doesn’t take much imagination to combine the natural and the mechanical, whatever they are.
