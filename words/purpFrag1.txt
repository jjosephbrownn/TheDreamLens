"One of the key twisting points is that of “hierarchy”.  We have talked to some who quietly maintain a life-long friendship, a deep-held and beautiful bond with someone else that, while tough, maintains a supple structure that allows for growth, shrinkage, and change.  The point of this bond is to mutate and its iterations are carefully inscribed on its skin, its many alterations showing carefully the path to this present point, arguing gently and firmly that it is as strong as it is today, stronger even, despite the distance, to the day it was first invoked.  Others come and go and are loved and lost and held dear but always in some way through the lens of this bond, marked in relation and in deference.  This is not strictly a hierarchy but perhaps a profound admission of uniqueness.  Fingerprints and irises.Some others talk of anarchy, the willful abandonment of terms of address and social position.  All links are sacred and written in their own language with their own orthodox if they have one at all.  Like the previous people these roots are allowed all the space and time they need to develop into whatever they will be or want or need to be.  Looked at from another angle this could be presumed to be “total hierarchy”, the absolute recoil where hierarchy and its opposite meet in the same place: each bond is viewed in its uniqueness and so equivalence and therefore hierarchy can never be possible but that at the same time holds all these bonds as primary and impossible in relation to each other.Others still have no idea what they are doing but know that they like people more than they dislike them, so that’s alright then.",
