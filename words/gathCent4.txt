`<h1>Commoner’s Ground</h1>
<p>It is getting dark now at around three o’clock and I’m out in the woods near the house around which my family has circulated since the ‘60s.  There aren’t many berries on the frequent holly bushes that cut the paths in two.  I’ve been told that this means that the winter will not be a bad one.</p>
<p>Entering into this small patch of woodland locally called “the common” is always noisy and disruptive.  The woods do not really have any extended persistence but have sprung up in answer to the quiet simmering of the household away in the background, behind the stand of fir trees.  When my predecessors planted themselves here they brought with them all manner of seedlings and cuttings to cultivate in the surrounding fields, stretches of blankness.  The fir tree was planted one particularly cold infant year after serving its duty as Christmas tree and it has since outgrown its allotted bed and towered above the small cottage, happy in its new home.</p>
<p>This wood is our attic and our store cupboard, pantry and cellar.  I do not live here and the earth is no longer used as common land for cultivation and pasture but something of its nurturing past subsists just beneath the soil.  Things grow well here and are kept in healthy leaf.  It has treated our memories well.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the wood is the first totem: the grave of the swing-tree.  This was a broad trunked, hulking growth with stocky boughs from which were hung during its life a variety of swings.  This is a focussing point for children, layered thinly over one another.  A heavy wind cast the tree down some years ago and it lies here still, fun to climb over.</p>
<p>Over the doorstep and down the path past the first holly and, thinking of the small task given to me, I note the few clusters of crimson berries hidden in its cave-like interior.  Paths dig into the sandy soil supporting withered bracken.  The next site is the apple tree, good for climbing on, under which is found a rather weathered and beleaguered bench.  Close by is the buried giant, his scalp just noticeable if you brush back the dry layer of earth.  These days his hair has grown long and tall as silver birches are apt, several times my height now when they had barely reached my elbows as a child.  The corrugated iron sheet sheltering the adder is somewhere around here but I have never been able to find it, that figure of the past long since faded into nothing but an outline and a light touch on taught skin of the local memory.</p>
<p>The strange characteristic of these woodlands is that they undulate erratically and sometimes sink into deep depressions, filled with soft leaves and broken boughs or still water.  I slide down into a ditch only to struggle up the other side with barely a thought for how the pram wheels found their footing on these muddy banks.  One such pit I stumble upon next, the bank beyond rising to its rim which then falls madly into a valley beyond which is the village.  I don’t go to the bottom of the hole.  Holly bushes grow effusively out of these pits but this one is empty and forbidding somehow, echoes of memories scraping rather too forcefully.</p>
<p>My goal is always to find the oak at the centre of the wood but its exact position eludes me every time.  It shifts across the substrate of this domain of tiles and crossings, a nomad that leaves no tracks.  This is part of the journey so I continue to walk along the paths keeping my mind floating serenely, allowing my footsteps to fall freely and unconsciously which is only sure way to know that you are on the right path. </p> 
<p>Past the apple tree the paths become unclear but there is a way to spot them.  You can’t look for them or seek them by signs and directions.  They appear to you in the corner of your eyes, suggest themselves in the shape of fallen leaves slight difference of plant growth.  Looking awry they float to the surface.  They can be hard to follow and sometimes fade into undergrowth and mud but other paths present themselves if you let them.  All of our boots through the years must have left an impression but still I am sure that I am led to different realms not by my own choosing but by the flow of past which is cut into the earth by habit and repetition, not always the best forces in a large family like mine.</p>
<p>I approach the oak from a different direction every time and I find myself on my journey back before I reach what I had assumed would be the turning point of my ramble.  One effect of this weight of the past is that it usually simple to orient yourself, the names and faces come easily to me.  A stranger might find it trickier but I have only tested this theory once with a close friend and, indeed, I found it much harder to find my way with another pair of eyes with me.</p>
<p>I stand under the oak after saying our silent greetings.  Using the familiar technique of unfocussing my eyes and casting my gaze through the wash of ash that has colonised this particular stretch I pick out no less than three paths leading away.  I consider each of them vaguely.  They all have their and consequent adventures.  My feet my kick up something none of us had remembered for a long time or I might stumble across something I had been looking for.  These stories hang in the air momentarily but I choose the path to my left.  The other two lead downhill and I am not ready to go further down than I have already ventured, plumping instead for the start of my emergence back into the now.  The ghosts follow me for a distance curiously and somewhat melancholically but they soon fade as my feet decisively tread the path I have chosen.  It is getting dark and I promised to be back at the house to start decorating the Christmas tree.</p>`
