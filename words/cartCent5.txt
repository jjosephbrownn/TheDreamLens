`<h1>Spring Cleaning</h1>
<p>Things push up. They stretch their muscles and heave against the weight of the earth above them, struggling for an age then, gradually, with the frozen ground beginning to crack, the teeming deadness is borne upwards and disgorged.  Sunlight floods in, new sunlight that is achingly familiar, bright and joyful in its new clothes.  Shifts and spasms below disturb the stable surface and all begin to sway in dance one which has not yet ended but has been delayed these past months.  
Whispers reach us from before and we remember.</p>
<p>Grinding and choking all is dislodged whilst creaking and complaining and aching and screeching, irresistible movement from below translated through layers upon layers of dust the complexity of movement and counter-movement, lunge and riposte, slipping and sliding so all is chaos and rambling growth.  We all feel it and we turn our faces upwards the soles of our feet for once doing the thinking processing faster than our primitive consciousness can bear, jealously confined to language and culture, shackled to words and sentences whilst out palms and fingers, brows and tongues, backs and hips career uncontrollably through the multitude of change, agonisingly incremental.</p>
<p>The whispers are so far away, they tickle and cavort but we may not understand them until the sun strikes the shaded brickwork, the bottom of the well, the headboard in the back bedroom and the cobwebs under the stairs.  It is a time of great upheaval and the wind drags us in all directions but the voices in the gales have changed timbre and are joined by new arrivals not seen for many months.</p>
<p>I feel myself changing; the sunlight touching my skin triggers new processes within me.  I begin to see more sharply and feel more profoundly whilst the hundred thousand channels within me race in pursuit of curious beasts possessed with wild eyes and shaggy coats and light hooves glimpsed from between the trees.</p>
<p>The whispers grow in strength and I see what I have seen before the images etched into dense wood in obscure places discovered again while wondering directionless and uncaring through forgotten pastures that I am certain were not here before, the turnings in the road deceiving me and the signs obscured mischievously by hanging ivy and lichen.  From here I can see where I have come from; my winding path flattened into the grass only partly obscured by trees and hills to be glimpse again from some other vantage point that I will come across presently in the late afternoon.  This too I can see only partially and vaguely and I am not yet certain where my feet will lead me or my eyes distract me.  Falling gently against the hedgerow I stop and am overtaken.  Endlessly will this continue in cycles far too large to ever grasp or foretell or relate or live and so I surrender to the aimless becoming driven by the grave turning of hidden wheels echoed distantly in some lower part of my mind as I degrade and collapse welcoming the unveiled rhythm at last as my own.</p>`
