<h2>Drone</h2>

<p>This is the long note or the long anything.  This idea is fairly simple as it coheres basically to our general understanding of drones as long sustained notes, chords or events.  Explode this idea and we get musical drone in general.  This could still be sustained musical moments but could also be applied to sustained moments in time (pieces of music or art that suspend normal understanding of time as described above) so that, even if the music is constantly changing, it induces a drone in the passing of time around the music.  The rhythmic pulse of drumbeats is also a drone.  In these distended examples of the drone concept the actual music does not need to be play uninterrupted or continuously.  The drone here applies to the effect of the actual music.  Rhythm and pulse are effects of percussive instruments and could maybe be described as “intensities” or affect (in the way a reader sympathetically feels boredom with a bored character in a book even if the reader is not bored themselves).  This is most easily felt in clubs especially ones where djs favour continuous pulse over hits.  The beat goes on despite gaps or breaks of actual spaces in the music (between notes for example).</p>
<p>A Classical example would be how Schenkerian theory understands key centres: whole sections of music are considered to be Tonic or Dominant even if the music is, at this point, not actually in the tonic key.  The point is that the tonic is implied at this point.  This is an important point.  Drones are most often implied or induced and only sometimes appear in the sound world.  Drones could be whole songs or melodies.  In Hindustani classical music a rag (a selection of tones, a key, an emotion, a time of day, certain melodic elements implied by the tones) describes the musical environment and a bandish (or composition) is used to actualise the character of the rag as a theme to be improvised upon.  In some sense this bandish sustains throughout an entire performance of a rag (note that performers perform a rag and not a bandish: the bandish is the tool to perform the rag) and can often be heard to continue playing underneath and through the performer’s improvisation.</p>
<p>This is something we actively employ in my performances.  When we play a composition the song is always being played in its “natural” state even as we improvise around it and even if none of us are actually playing any part of the song at one time (we like to think that it is being played in its original by a silent extra player).</p>`
