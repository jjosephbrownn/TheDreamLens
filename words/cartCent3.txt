`<h2>to the editing cartographers</h2>

<p>hold out your hands palms up and wriggle your fingers curving the flats into lakes and your wrists into plateaus </p>
<p>bones pulse and shift showing beneath the surface and flexing too far snap back to the warm comfort of the imprint left behind</p>
<p>fluid surfaces are imprinted and scored for a time by your movements lending the vectors and differentials of your hidden smile a permanence in the body between us</p>
<p>we were foreign objects estranged and unfriendly but we fell and were led down an easy and well-lit way that spiralled and progressed diverging and sometimes confusing but always signposted by explorers and adventurers although there are fewer on this obscure route than there might once be or will have been or even on the well-travelled thoroughfares on the other side</p>
<p>our body extends limbs are appropriated and appendages put into common use from one mouth we speak and eyes become hands feeling our way the ear through the ages listening to the quickening pulse and transmitting the compression to the extremities where they are sent riotously into the deep spaces between teeth</p>
<p>we are not receivers anymore, aerials tuned to common frequencies but speakers and noise makers the heart pulsing a sign organising an indifferent succession into machine code sending convulsions across our surfaces </p>
<p>and we tear down the submissive sensation a lover and appendages agents fabricating the currents in the fields around us appropriating their matter and forming limbs and muscles organs bound together with rough twine</p>
<p> have had to learn the signs which only appear rarely but i am getting better and more prepared</p>
<p>whenever they dig deeply i can hear the call and once again see clearly the lighted way trodden only a few times by feet that were mine (and are still in fibrous memory) led down by new hands gripping absorbing new signs and new fingerprints and the palms shaping to form lakes in which we can swim safely</p>

<p>from part-remembered stopovers on my journey</p>`
