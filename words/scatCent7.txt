`<h1>Windows</h1>
<h2>Written by Autumn Andersen</h2>
<p>Insofar as the window was a fragile object cajoling the world into instances of light and shadow the scenes outside were regrettably bland and wilted.  Rain was pattering on the glass in what was probably meant to be a friendly manner but it was doing a bad job covering up its lazier efforts on the street below where it poured down unrelentingly and ultimately indifferently amongst the metal staircases and shimmering shiny avenues.  Higher up amid the lights and reflected warmth of the upper stories it was providing a better show but practically no one was interested.  It had all been seen before.</p>
<p>There were only a few lamps burning in this small room.  They were all situated on low tables or hidden amongst unkempt houseplants that had made significant headway in colonising the many bookshelves that lined the walls.  Fragments of light, softened around the edges, fell in coils over the walls and floors, winding themselves around each other, meeting and parting again through the slightly musty air.  Some found an escape at the window and they joyously arced outwards into the fresh air tugging on the strands left draped over the sill and the furniture, introducing an intimate tension between companions and an attention on the night beyond the glass which called to them quietly.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter to the light but the window was open.  The bottom sash was raised a few inches and a wet draft blew into the room, refusing to mix with the papery elegance of the room’s other occupants.  In contrast to the stillness of the front room this gust was heavy and uneven on its feet.  It shuffled papers, lifted the curtains momentarily and settled damply on shoulders bringing with it the promise of billowing coats, misted cheeks and ruffled hair scattered through with fine droplets.  It also brought in the rain which dropped onto the bare floorboards by under the sill.</p>
<p>Fran got up and closed the window, resting her weight on the top of the sash until it slid down and cut out the night.  Here was a square of blackness dazzled with raindrops.  Settling down again in the corner the window drew her gaze as it had drawn the light all evening.  She had lit the lamps and watched as the patches of shadow crept away into obscure corners where the lighted fingers couldn’t find them behind sturdy furniture or out of sight behind doors.  The cavity of the room was well-travelled, homely known country, a roof of firelight.  Fran had searched flea markets and second-hand shops for most of her weekends throughout September for small lamps and curious bulbs simply in order to avoid turning on the ceiling light which, even with the pretty wooden shade she had found for it, cast its arms out like a searchlight and pinned all her things to the floor under a paranoid inquisition.  She preferred the multiplicity of lights, the clamour and chorus of voices and faces that could be moved and combined to the singular clinical organisation of her lighted space.</p>
<p>A knock on her door clattered through the room and all faces turned expectantly to the hall.  Fran got up and let her feet carry her over floorboards and rugs to the front door in a hallway unlit and gloomy.   A tumble of clicks opened the latch and Ola came into sight a little cold from the night.  Fran led her through into the front room where Ola sat down and was, for a few moments, the centre of attention.  An hour or two passed and a few bottles of wine were opened.  It had been some weeks since they had last met and there was much to catch up on. </p>
<p>In a brief period of quiet Fran, who was caught pleasantly in a tipsy circle of thoughts, was surprised by Ola’s voice that, before, had been low and full of laughter but was now edged with a bite of concern.</p>
<p>“I passed someone on the landing you know”<br>
Fran took a second to think.  Someone was circling their warm and fragile clearing.<br>
“I suppose that will be Simon.  I’ve been meaning to see him for a while but we’ve both been very busy.  Life is hard for us at the moment, work is tough”.  She bit her lip.  “Will you excuse me for a second?”<br>
“Of course” replied Ola.
<p>Fran rose and walked through the dancers and out into the hall.  Turning right, away from the front door she walked towards the window at the end of the passage which, in the gloom, was a frame of dull light.  She passed into the small room in at the end of the hall.</p>
<p>“Sorry I’ve been so distant recently.  Work has been crazy and I don’t like being attached to my phone so much.  It drives me up the wall”<br>
“That’s ok” smiled Simon “you only had to say.  I can’t monopolise your time you know”<br>
He grinned again and brushed the back of Fran’s palm with his fingers.  Fran looked down and frowned at all the things around Simon’s feet that he wasn’t aware of.  Simon spoke again:<br>
“Who’s in there with you?  You have a lot of friends here, something I haven’t found a lot of yet”.  The smile was still there but his eyes were balanced over her shoulder.<br>
“That’s Ola, she’s a good friend.  I can tell her most things and she understands.  It’s a shame she couldn’t get here to earlier to see Jep before he left for his date”</p>
<p>Simon’s face was impassive.  It was early days and Fran hadn’t really had a chance to talk to him.  Also these things were hard to bring up and there was never the right time.  You needed confidence to reset the compass points and shyly show someone behind the grimy frontage of appearances.  Abruptly Simon got up and made moves similar to those made by someone about to leave but more forced, as if distracting.</p>
“Well ok.  I don’t mind.  I guess thanks for being honest.  I don’t have a problem with, you know, other people but yeah it’s not for me.  I’m not sure I could handle it.  Thanks for the lovely days we had though.  I’ll remember them”.  He sat back down again and smiled faintly.</p>
<p>Fran got up, also smiled faintly and left the room.  It was a shame; at first glance the confusion of dancing figures had scared him off.  Not used to sharing she supposed.  Standing by the hall window Fran heard scratching coming from behind her and, on turning, saw letters etching themselves into the dark wood of the old door.</p>
<p>“Cannot see more than one they belong and they shall stay owned commit to the path and keep walking”</p>
<p>The handwriting was rushed and energetic and the pen had scratched the wallpaper underneath where the writing had flowed beyond the doorframe and onto the wall.</p>
<p>On entering the front room again Ola turned and put down the book she had been reading.  There was a moment of warmth and recognition.<br>
“Didn’t go well?”<br>
“No”<br>
“These things happen.  It’s a hard thing to talk about, most people just don’t want to know.”</p>
<p>Underneath the closeness and was a deep well of difference.  The floorboards for a moment became thin and flexible and the light behind Ola threw her body into darkness just as coaxed luminous threads from the chair and table beside her.  Ola’s words, although intimate and well-chosen struggled to maintain their moment in the turgid air and fell to the floor flapping weakly.</p>
<p>A movement in the kitchen distracted Fran from this instant of shadows.  With a glance at Ola and a quick smile Fran stepped over the threshold into the kitchen, placing her hands on the table.  The room was submerged in a darkness that cupped the whole space in its palms.  Against the window was a figure slightly illuminated by the lamps from the front room, the light of which had followed Fran in curiosity.</p>
<p>Tim turned and fixed Fran with a look that was heavy with disappointment and hurt.  Fran looked at her hands and wished it were over.  Across the surface of the table was scrawled and incoherent tumble of ill thoughts that took up so much room the author had had to squeeze the last few sentences onto the sides of the table top and had even resorted to scribbling on Fran’s hands.  She didn’t read it.  She already knew what it was going to say before the ideas had settled in the spaces between the words.  She felt antagonised and worthless.  She had met Tim recently and they had got on well enough before he had found out about Ola and Jep at which point Fran had been rewritten and the tentative pages that had started to form were torn through and restructured.  </p>
<p>Fran turned to go as Tim sulkily looked through the glass.  There were a lot of barriers to liking someone it seemed and the smallest thing could upset it.  Tim hadn’t allowed himself to like Fran and couldn’t acknowledge or condone a friendship based on what he knew.  </p>
<p>Back in the front room Ola was standing in front of the window watching the rain.  She hadn’t heard Fran come back in and was quiet in her contemplation.  The window only afforded a narrow view of the buildings opposite and to the flat-owners opposite Ola must have been a dark, lovely shape against a warm cushion of light.  If you opened the window and leaned out you could look down the road to the park or up it to the church on the corner of the street.  Fran walked over and put her hand on Ola’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“I was just thinking that your apartment must look very strange to those people over there” Ola said. “You just have books and lamps.  From their room all they will be able to see is the different lights wherever they escape.  Your windows are like cracks in a wall or gaps in floorboards which you can put your eye to.  And we are just dark shapes moving across the light.”</p>
<p>Fran looked out too and saw her reflection hanging in the wet air outside.  Her skin was scratched all over with thin handwriting detailing everything that had been said to her.  She was a softly lit spectre in the weighty city air.</p>
<p>She reaches out intending to open the sash again but at the last moment changes her mind and instead grasps the sill and frame.  Tilting it against her she swivels it round with some difficulty so that she can balance it on floor, still upright.  Through it she could see Ola turning to answer the door – three rings of the bell, Jep’s customary signal.  The night surrounds her and she peers into her collection of spaces.  Thinking for a moment Fran looks about her at the tilting light and crowded multitude of caresses each one complimenting and involving like no other but still lending their limbs to the effort of keeping the walls from sliding in.  The light drizzle washed over her and she begins to smudge away the writing before Jep could see that she had been worrying again.</p>
