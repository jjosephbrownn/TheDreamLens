`<h1>The high tarn and the old men</h1>
<p>A spirit level balanced between shoulders and knees.  The clear water tips and sways but always the breath of air finds its place again.  Things here are in balance and this swathe of flat ground is found by many feet along the way.</p>
<p>Having walked all day along stony paths that wound their way through the yearling peaks, the trembling stands of pines and, soon, the slick, rocky slopes of scree and moss that were fed by the lakes to the north we found ourselves, after a steep climb beside a chattering stream that left us as downtrodden as the gravel and mud beneath us, at a tarn snugly fitted between two high peaks.  The right hand spur curved down to meet us ending in a final watchtower before collapsing into the narrow channel that grasped the small stream â€“ on this bank we ended up and pitched our tents in the gathering moist evening.  It had been sunny but now clouds lowered over us and the air was misty and damp. </p>
<p>Only now as we sat and rested did we see how the plateau was formed.  Between the two peaks, left and right was a sheer wall of mossy rock that plunged directly into the water, sharp and steely.  Clasped in the hands of the old men of stone, the lake caught the stars falling as the night sky was cast as a blanket over the hill.  Bent shoulders and stiff necked the old men watched, crouched and umoving their breath rumbling and eyebrows craggy with concern as they patiently panned the sky grit.</p>
<p>The bass muttering filled our dreams and we slept on their knees beside their pool, tired and unkempt.  The sky bent towards us, funnelled and warped by the crystal water, a cold ocean reflected in square mile of clear, chill liquid gathered by the rills and fractures scored into the collapsed, ancient bodies of the hills.  Tears of the heavens scraped and salvaged.</p>
<p>The high voice of a young girl seared the silence, the dream fabric was all of a sudden blown and harried by a strong wind and I turned to listen the desperate sobs and quiet tears of someone close to our tent.  Stumbling around our midnight shelter, they meandered and slowly, by a circuitous route, left the confines of the mirror and fled into the night.  Star gazing as ever the old men shifted uneasily but could not be torn away from their mirror.</p>
<p>In the morning we awoke to solid glass stretching away before us.  Our eyes would not tell us where the water ended and cliff began.  In a deep doze the old men had fallen silent, the wandering spirits quietened and damped down.  This level of the land was held in perfect stillness and the water had smoothed to become the morning sky, silkily metamorphic cliffs and the endlessness of the day all below us.  In this perfect poise we packed up our tents, erased the marks of our passing and left the spirit level, climbing the nearby summit through layers of thought and the gates of the haruspex and into the quiet valleys of hereafter. </p>`
