This morning I felt like I was caught in a web of barbed wire being pulled in all directions.  I would stand up straight, be punctual and be those things people expected of me.  I am pierced through by the needs of a passing time.  I am strung out, stretched and distorted by models of perfection and ideals of manhood and citizenship.  I am kept weighed down by the gaze of an insubstantial shadow etched into every medium imaginable across this city.  This is me as I am told to be.  My eyes keep me from straying and whenever I am in doubt I hear my voice in my ear keeping me on the straight and narrow, turning me from the less travelled paths.  I have had my body torn from me, my tastes stolen and my thoughts turned against me, weaponised and rationalised.  I am the most concrete reflection of uncountable others, the locus where all others contribute a small part of their being and at the same time I am broken and shattered and shared out.  Every part I discover is soon ground up, redistributed and requisitioned. I am the core and the periphery in tension.
