`<h1>Empty Time</h1>
<h2>Written by Hendra Wednesday</h2>
<p>I was getting a bit bored sitting around all of the time.  Time is never really anyone’s friend but for young people it has become an obstacle and a nuisance.  My parents never faced prolonged bouts of boredom and emptiness which has led to them telling me, admittedly infrequently, that only boring people are bored.  Unfortunately this has stayed with me, lodging in some comfortable lower area of my consciousness where it can wriggle and complain as much as it wants without the fear of being evicted.  </p>
<p>Time is now an enemy to be conquered, filled in and used up efficiently.  I have been up for three hours and I have done nothing creative.  I will go to work soon and cram the eight hours until midnight allowing the shop floor to become dirty then cleaning it again.  People will come and go and I will make things for them.  This is pretty boring but it is apparently useful to someone.  My footsteps and elbow grease induct profit into four or five pockets and a rather smaller package into my own, more modestly sized, pockets.  Eight hours of cyclical activity with no progression apart from my own time and income.  This seems pretty much entirely wasteful to me but I still regard it as a better use of my time than sitting on a sofa and scribbling.  Likewise, communities at large view my sitting in a hot coffee shop as more productive than just letting me get up to some things at home that may or may not end in some art at some point.  It probably has something to do with getting paid.  I get to do something as pointless as sitting on my own in a quiet room but the richer people pay me for it, so they can forget about me and count my activity off as paid-for labour.  Being by myself scares them.  What could I be up to that isn’t being regulated by a regular wage?</p>
<p>So I have this gap to fill.  Six hours to use up.  I might draw something or I might skim through Facebook for a bit.  Wait for the rain to stop and consider making some lunch.  I will ignore the itching in my fingers and the quiet nagging in my head that signals that I have forgotten to do something.  Or, rather, that I have slowly and quietly designed a system in my head the default setting of which is “there is something to remember to do” and which starts to vibrate and grumble when I am idle no matter how many times I go through my schedule and tell myself I had nothing planned.  There is simply no teaching this demon.  It will continue to remind me to do something whether there ever was something to do or not.  I eventually end up doing something.</p>
<p>After a summer of lazing and exploring I find myself with the rest of my life laid out as empty space just crying out to be filled.  “How will I plan my life so as to make the best use of this space?” I ask myself sycophantically.  “Get a job I suppose”, says the sensible part of me that has never heard of rhetoric.  “Pay the rent”.  This seems like a worthwhile goal: pay the rent.  Earn enough to keep the flat minimally my own.</p>
<p>Job opportunities being what they are, I have a lot of free time on my hands.  There was a time when bodies would float through the manoeuvres, seamlessly joining the strips of cloth from school to vocation to retirement.  We are consumers.  We are told to reinvent ourselves, invest in our personalities and spend time detailing our brand to companies who might buy us as component parts for their own swift machines.  “Spending” time.  There we have it.  Faced with the image of exchanging dead but apparently valuable objects for stuff we need it is no wonder that we think of our time as currency to be pushed into the slot machines in hope of more shiny discs.  Spending time to reward ourselves with time we actually want.  Invest the time now and get more later!  These horizons barricade our world into a thronging exchange where each participant has been funnelled into the space where our usefulness is objectified in the way in which we eat up our time. </p>
<p>I worry about spending mine as I worry about spending my money.  What shall I do today to use my time in the pursuit of being creative.  If I must entwine temporality into the creative process how do I enmesh?  I spend my coin and time grinds on embedded into what I am doing.  Time is like petrol, it makes the engine go.  Without time everything grinds to a halt.  This is the way I understand time.  I cannot break out.  I have been taught too well.</p>
<p>I got up to go into town.  I needed some things from the shop before I could go to work.  I go to work to fund my musical addiction but I end up using my off-days to buy groceries, wash and catch up on sleep.  This closed loop doesn’t end and time is the backbone, the skeleton of this vortex.  If it weren’t for time I could come home from work, sleep as much as I needed and productively get my shit done.  My schedule would work if time weren’t a factor.  Things take too long, see?</p>
<p>I clock in then clock out and the hours are matched up, somewhere deep in the computer system, to pay-rates, holiday pay and tips.  Somewhere a bit-bureaucrat tallies up the National Insurance.  £7.25.  That is how much my work is worth in one hour.</p>
<p>So. </p>
<p>Time is money or, more accurately, value.  I have a lot of it at the moment and I can’t seem to use it.  The government are perpetually and astonishingly uninterested in my skill set meaning there are no jobs or meaningful employment just waiting to be filled.   The million-dollar question for millennials at the current time seems to be this:  bearing in mind that you are a generation of talented, emotionally switched on, deep-thinking, self-aware, politically active and socially explorative people living in an economy that does not care one jot about your pretty little life, just how are you spending your precious time? 
No wonder we take so many selfies.</p>`
