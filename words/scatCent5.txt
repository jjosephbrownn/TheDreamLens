`<h1>Scatter Chapter &: Sleeping Quest</h1>
<p>Amid the dunes of my everyday sometimes a peak pushes its way through the listless sands and drifting dust.  Sometimes I accidentally brush away some grime and nosing through are memories that are so strange and achingly familiar that it seems that they must have been gifted to me by the hand of a god.  Blankets of noise and routine cover completely the churning masses below them with thick, syrupy tedium but they are not totally waterproof and evidently something manages to find its way through these difficult barriers.</p>
<p>i have come round to thinking that i am back to back with myself.  while one sleeps the other keeps watch as a sentinel over a quarry whose identity is unknown to them but whom still faithfully and patiently keeps their post throughout the night.  neither recognise themselves in the other and can anyway not see for the lack of moon or stars in what each of them believe to be the deepest  night imaginable.</p>
<p>and this time a memory breaks through.  sandy earth awash with thick stemmed yellow grasses in a pine wood heavy with the scent of thyme coaxed from the forest floor by a bright sun that splits itself into fragments on the sharp needles high up.  the ground arches as we rouse ourselves from under a woody scrub, leaves rattling and are pushed forward by our guide, thick yellow hair and dulled armour shining. in a hollow three paths leave us regretfully and we linger wasting daylight.  over the crest of the hill a few last scotch pines flex under the weight of the pulsing sky and are turned this way and that by a soft breeze that winds its way through the stout grasses, combing sand into neat piles that whisper and hiss as the grass in turn sketches intricate patterns into their sliding contours. slipping away from us a flat and hot land, carpeted with rich grass and herbs and broken by spines of dark rock.  the shade here is cool and we will not leave, vertigo tugs at our limbs as we turn back into the whispering woodland to find a new course.</p>
<p>new voices join us, ones that are familiar, but eerily, as if from a dream.  we still search, trailing these fellow travellers.  something of a different world lingers around their bearing, they speak in voices that reach into us even as their empty words rattle on the ground.  we settle down to dream.</p>
<p>i rise and as i sleep and rejoin this world from which i write with no memory of my sleeping self in that verdant rocky landscape filled with alien questions and distant answers that will mean nothing to my currently conscious self.  echoes bound off those spurs of stone and scent laden branches that chime against my cage of bone and dream but which speak in confusing and nostalgic mystery.  the sentinels speak in whispers, turning over the sleepy mutters of their charge in their mind while waiting out the deep night, reflected in the still pool round which they wander, the night sky turning forever above or below.</p>
<p>somewhere i am a on a journey of such importance that it must be kept secret from the stony guard behind me.  slivers fall at my feet and i puzzle over them from time to time.  they never match up, they are all middle pieces with no edges or corners to give a clue to where i might be. whenever i drift down meaning find myself wandering lost the scenes i am met with are vague and meaningless, although there is always an ember of something burning under the images, translucent as they are but still impenetrable.</p>
<p>the dunes shift again and are reshaped.  i live in imprints, the cavorting rhythms below throw up all kind of bizarre outlines that my aching head interprets erratically as signals from another world. i work with dust, an inconsistent medium.  inexpressible chaos and complexity combed into whirls and waves by the skimming hems of the fabrics of the dancers above and shaken into hills by the pounding of their feet from below.  i scrabble on my knees in amongst the heaps and sift it through my hands, little is left, a passing shadow and shallow imprint.  i keep them just the same.</p>`
