<h1>Gather – The Body and Discursive Subjectivity </h1>
<p><i>The voice isn’t necessarily individual; it belongs to a community, to a culture, to a society.</i>
-	Holly Herndon</p>
<p> A key theme in this project is focus on a critique of the idea of the body and biological sex as a foundation for cultural expression.  Judith Butler in Gender Trouble marks the compulsory order of sex/gender/desire as a problematic starting place for feminist politics, and by extension our project, owing to its stake in a pre-discursive existence of a body.  In this logical formation there exists something that predates our current political context as a “citizen”, “criminal”, “Londoner”, that claims to have been consistent before these processes were enacted upon us: the body which will become a Londoner, the subject that “decides” to be a criminal.  Butler argues against the causal/temporal logic of this prediscursive materiality by asserting that political subjects are formed by biological/medical/juridical discourses.</p>
<p>Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst’s explorations into artificial intelligence (AI) touch on a few of these areas.  Herndon’s album Proto was written using an AI called “Spawn”, a neural network which was trained with samples and recordings of Herndon’s own work.  The issue with training AI, Herndon claims, is that AI is not very clever: it requires a human input and cannot learn without being provided with a curriculum, so to speak.  Feeding the computer old work will simply result in “new” old work – the AI is creative up to a limit that is entirely discursive.  The body of work and the body of the AI are found in the same space which is defined both by Herndon’s code and the composition of data sets with which to feed the AI.  Art is made in the discursive construction of a context or an assemblage of creative humanity.  As Lisa Blackman explains, “the body is not bounded by the skin, where we understand the skin to be a kind of container for the self, but rather our bodies always extend and connect to other bodies, human and non-human, to practices, techniques, technologies and objects which produce different kinds of bodies” (p1).  Herndon articulates her body of work by extending into a program that can articulate right back at you.</p>
<p>This eco-system complicates any notion of predetermined grounds for subjectivity through the self-reflexive closed loop of communication: human writes program, program writes human.  Both bodies are in the process of writing themselves: Herndon’s use of AI disrupts the notion of a natural ground through which subjectivity enacts its own existence.  To put it in Blackman’s terms “the body is a process […] it cannot be stopped”.  The communication between Herndon and the “Spawn” questions the very formation of a human subject by presenting to us a totally prescribed machine, something articulated at every turn, a process of becoming.  In Herndon’s own words, “AI is ultimately useless without us [… ] AI is just us, in aggregate”.</p>
<p>This project digitally enacts the process of embodiment and discursive grounding.  An identity that can be said to pre-exist its articulation is blind to the matrix of human consciousness through which it was produced.  This blindness is symptomatic of patriarchal, capitalist society that must hide its methods of suppression whilst positing its own methods of control and systems of knowledge as irrevocably beyond politics or political colouration.  In butler’s words:  “Gender is […] the discursive/cultural means by which “sexed nature” or a “natural sex” is produced and established as “prediscursive”, prior to culture, a politically neutral surface on which culture acts” (emphasis original) (p7)</p>

<h2 class = "pseudo">Bodies of work / physiology of the site</h2>
<p class = "pseudo">Who writes these destinies of biological nature?  Walking through our home is an exercise in pulling together and rewriting.  A room here is an open sky dotted with stars.  The visitor is gently nudged to start drawing and very soon constellations start to appear.  What is initially an open scatter starts to mould itself to some sort of intelligible form.  Similarly, a room in which a text is presented has its consistency pulled apart when other texts start to force their way between the neat sentences.  What does it mean to “make sense” when other voices push their way in and dissolve the syntax, short-circuiting two disparate assemblages so that they interfere with one another? </p>
<p class = "pseudo">This wing of the house is named Gather and it is here that we remember, reminisce, and form our thoughts.  We’re always surprised at how disparate the memories can be because, in the heat of nostalgia, the material softens, mixing with other memories, bleeding all sorts of colours from one place to another.  But when examined a bit more closely we can start to see how these spreadings are born in the moment rather like when ice cubes melt in a glass on the way to sweaty room temperature.</p>
<p class = "pseudo">In other places we may deal with stories and information but here we are fixated on objects and their myriad ways of propagating and intermingling.  Another word may be taxonomy and in the dark rooms we like to pore over star charts and chronologies of old kings and queens.  These destinies are malleable: “The very form of coalition, of an emerging and unpredictable assemblage of positions, cannot be figured in advance” (p14).  We bring these objects together but it cannot really be said that they have any past consistency as the weaving itself allows us to pretend they ever were singular.  </p>
<p class = "pseudo">The room with the shifting text is an excellent example, see the video titled “textHighlightFracture” in the appendices for a quick example.  Here we have a nice poem or a bit of memory written down by one or other of us (Hendra goes in for these things more often that Autumn) that seems to make a certain sense but the arrival of other words unsettles this initial feeling.  Did it ever make sense?  Why am I privileging the initial text, the supposed ground when this new text has opened meaningful doors that I didn’t know existed? The “original” text is in itself a convergence of texts, they just look coherent because they appear in the same handwriting.  Herndon touches on something similar in her exploration of AI learning material.  Whatever the system is fed will inevitably reappear in the finished product as the data is simply a set of commands and prompts.  Listening to Beethoven will not fill the AI with enthusiasm for, say, Nicki Minaj.</p>
<p class = "pseudo">We have made an effort to group the texts into categories and the Gather wing of work tends to be about history, lists of star names and the like but these categories are necessarily mushy.  The band Hen Ogledd work in a similar magical realist/taxonomical space which has somewhat paved the way for us.  Richard Dawson, singer and bassist, often sprinkles his work with album-spanning motifs – the apostles (Nothing Important), local memory (The Glass Trunk) – which appear like objects of renaissance symbolism to draw thin strands of recollection between otherwise disparate songs.  Hen Ogledd, which also comprises Rhodri Davies, Dawn Bothwell, Sally Pilkington, abstract this tendency by forming whole songs based on lists of Welsh words and scientific disciplines, train of thought pronouncements on Scottish kingdoms and angry letters to the council concerning recycling.  Lists and collections are inherently capable of being sub-categorised, rewritten, and cross-referenced and it is this mode of world-building that we, like Hen Ogledd, invoke in this setting.</p>
<p class = "pseudo">Musically, we focus on organum and polyphony because it seems to us that extrapolating melodies and variations from a ground distends the original motif.  The melody exists in its raw form, and nothing seems more routed in tradition and the eternal than a cantus firmus, but the addition of voices derived from those notes draw out the latent and silent possibilities in the staid, non-metrical and strictly functional cantus.  </p>
<p class = "pseudo">Incidentally, the melody itself is written from your footsteps.  Each category represents a degree of a normalised scale, zero to seven, and a note is added each time you navigate somewhere else.  You might end up with this array: [0,5,3,6,4,7].  This data set represents mappable index positions of a mode array, for example [0,2,4,5,7,9,11,12], the degrees of the ionian mode.  The code picks the notes of the mode based on the indexes of the melody picked up along the way.  The result of the example here would be [0,9,4,11,7,12] which plays a melody in the ionian mode.  The “original melody” can be thus mapped to any mode, which is chosen on page load.  This intangible ground means nothing by itself and can only be actualised by its relation to a sister mode.  Section 2.2 contains a thorough walkthrough of the code and functionality of this program.</p>
<p class = "pseudo">This body of work represents our tangible forms.  We come together in their coming together and are written in the combination and digression of the various places.  Previously we did not exist but are called into some form of materiality by the interplay of the forces at work here.  We disown the idea that we must exist materially before being able to express our nature as we have no nature and our expression is our material.</p>
