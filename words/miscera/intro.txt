<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><i>People will write a song about topic A, but I want to come up with a production method that deals with topic A. The music can speak explicitly about it, but I don’t want to rely on lyrics or language. I want the process to be dealing with the object of critique.</i>       -	Holly Herndon</p>

<p>Our home is found in this interactive website environment which generates music and audio-visual scenarios through interaction with texts, star maps, and archives of photographs and maps.  By situating rooms throughout a discontinuous space we attempt to question both chronological and temporal norms of music listening/making and framings of creativity that centre the coherent subject as the primary generator of art.  A strict or mapped path is not offered, the listener must find their own way through using confusing or muddied signposts.  Navigation is hampered by unreliable gateways, passwords that do not work or hidden portals that turn out to be fakes.  Some rooms are familiar at once whilst others reveal themselves slowly.  As the listener progresses, footsteps are left behind that are used to build musical information, suggest similar text or image files to be loaded or to generate new ways of navigating the terrain.  The navigation itself acts as an engine to transform the piece of art in increasingly disruptive ways.</p>
<p>In this way, the project aims at a subjective, narrative-driven experience of a work of art that depends less on the frame presented by the artist and more on the movement of the listener.  Although, to a certain extent, there will always be a frame present (someone had to write the code after all) this project is concerned more with the appearance of non-linearity, of the illusion of disparate states that can arise from determinate sources.  This is inevitable as websites do not just appear, they must be determined, they must contain assets and dependencies and they must be invoked, articulated, their presence (http-) requested, and finally enunciated by a browser.  However, there are routes through these structures and, as Paul Gilroy has suggested, routes can determine roots.</p>
<p>It seems to us that a more traditional way of presenting music interpellates the listener in a specific way, as a receiver of musical information.  Georgina Born writes of music journals gathering and delineating their audiences, not only attracting them with their niche information but articulating their materiality as a community of readers in the process.  We are keen to allow the visitor some sense of control over this process – their own interpretation of our messages and maps will be instrumental in the creation of the subsequent music.  There is some precedent in pop music for this kind of staging: Radiohead with their “pay what you feel” releases; Wayne Krantz’ weekly uploads of live recordings from their residency at 55 Bar in New York; a similar archive of live recordings made available (also PAYF) by Fugazi; Kaiser Chief’s fourth album The Future is Medieval which was made available in a pick ‘n’ mix format with fans able to sell on their own compilations for a commission.  These formats destabilise some of the norms of music production and distribution but are limited to a degree by their existence in determinate form.  By removing possibilities for sedimentary determinations accruing over time we hope to allow a degree of interactivity that goes beyond the usual remixing, spatialising, reordering processes inherent in, for example, Nicolás Jaar’s interactive album Telas which loops sections of the record according to user input but which already possesses a high degree of creative momentum that cannot be derailed.</p>
<p>This is a site of ergodic literature, whose traversal and understanding depends upon, and is established by, the interpretative effort of the visitor.  Literature itself makes its own arguments but a house needs to be explored before it can be known properly which is why we continually refer to this place as a mysterious building.  Architecture and space are probably better tools to understand the spatialised, non-linear, hidden and dusty nature of the music than strict musicological or literary methodologies.  The fact that this house possesses no material foundations is not important.  </p>
<p>David Gauntlett in his book Making is Connecting argues that the difference between art and craft is one of determination: art must be submitted to a board, be processed, and interpreted, and spat out as a work of art.  Craft on the other hand, is determined by the maker – it requires no input from anyone else unless they want to use it or wear it or eat it.  In this sense the site resembles a junk shop rather than an art gallery, which is the usual metaphor for music that engages with a curatorial style of presentation.  Both environments are curated but the “direction” of organisation is different: galleries are initiated with a program of curation; junk shops are retroactively curated.  In a junk shop, the objects are accumulated over time in a haphazard fashion within a territory that ascribes them a “waiting to be found” determination that acts from above to designate its own boundaries.  While this territory links the objects together the reality the of junk shop is compiled from its contents with no further agenda of accumulation other than the objects’ own status of unwanted, useless or surplus to requirements.  Art galleries accumulate actively, parsing, rejecting and accepting submissions based on formula specific to the contingent rules of the curation in question.  This project conspires with this allegory at the level of appearance.  The junk shop curatorial ontology is an illusion but the shape of this formula – that some things can be grouped together because of their differences and their lack of prearranged consistency as opposed to a creative algorithm that generates works within an almost familial narrative of lineage and imminent similarity – will form the bare bones of our contextual theory.</p>
<p>The following text will engage with the context and themes that have proven to be important to the construction of this place.  Like the wings of the house the sections presented now are ordered with the same taxonomy that categorises the project itself.  <b>“Scatter”</b> will deal with narrative, irony, lineage and fiction; <b>“<a class="miscLink" id="gathTag">Gather</a>”</b> with bodies, identity and subjectivity; <b>“Cartography”</b> with power, discourse, bodies and musicians; and <b>“Repurpose”</b> with technology, binaries, exclusionary politics and organicity.  Under the heading <b>“Miscera”</b> will be found bibliographies, discographies and other sources and <b>“Lacunae”</b> will hold the appendices and paraphernalia relevant to the project.  In the latter section can be found a thorough “plan” of the site along with technical details for navigation and the bones of the logging/cookies engine.  <b>“Tatters”</b> will contain concluding remarks.  Underlined comments will suggest links to the appendices and appropriate videos, case studies and diagrams.  See Figure 1 in Section 1.2 for an explanation of the navigation program.</p>
