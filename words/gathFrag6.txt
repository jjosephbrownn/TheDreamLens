this has become our home.  hidden away from the hard surfaces of the material world here we can sit in quiet and tranquillity along with the ebb and flow of machine code and information.  we do not recognise inside and outside, matter and memory, body and mind, word and mouth.  here our voices are indistinguishable from our tongues, our music indistinguishable from our instruments, our words indistinguishable from our breath.  forgotten we find hearing and being heard in the same moment.
voices mingled like this we forget that we are discrete bodies; autumn and hendra.  but those names are masks – proper nouns tasked with unfolding the complexities of our bodies and distributing them into unequal timelines, weighting them with coloured faces adorned with feathers and sequins.
under the weight of the smooth bone structures we manage to live quietly and work noisily.  our voices will one day raze tower blocks and flatten palaces but here we still struggle with the burdens we have only just found belong to us.  all we can do for the moment is laugh and exchange masks. look how funny we seem in each other’s clothes.
if we are written then here reside our bodies.  encoded and productive, wired through with functions and algorithms.  these tasks fold back on themselves, the printing press constructs itself out of repurposed type.  we can only be written as far as we write, only speak as far as we are spoken.
these diverse channels are in total chaos and we apologise for not being tidier.  in conversation with one another the varying leaves float and clatter out of time.  our bodies are the surface where they are written and brought into accord – disorganised and insubstantial as they are.  among the flickering surfaces and frames of these embodied moments emerge scenarios and stories which we have tried to tell but which will inevitably end up mismatched and incoherent.  we cannot help the stuttering.
