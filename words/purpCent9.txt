`<h1>Chapter..,,..: 40 Voices and Concrete Spheres</h1?>
<p>Encasing, covering, diving, smothering, layering, immersing, wallowing.  </p>
<p>I have been sitting on this leather sofa in a dim and bare concrete room underground for about fifteen minutes.  My feet tap more or less silently on the floor.  Sometimes I have my eyes open, peering between the five speakers in front of me to the open door through which light and distant noise spills, the harbour mouth as the only point of transition along the wall supporting the weight of the water.  Sometimes I close my eyes and let the voices spanned around me in a circle spark and burn and sputter out and die down and swell and fall.  Even with my eyes closed the space is so striking that it extends into my imagination.  Although, being a musician, I am plenty experienced at building landscapes for the sounds arriving in my head this space seems apt to house the forty strong host turning up on my doorstep.  </p>
<p>Although the door is open there is very little sound aside from the voices.  They sing in the cavernous reverb of their setting then reverberate further in mine.  The effect is a chain of echoes and spatializing: the recording setting, the concrete bunker, my head.</p>
<p>I am on edge.  Tension rises, supporting my usually sloping and slouching spine.  Every muscle is tense allowing even the smallest excitation to crackle and career through the taught bands of flesh amplifying.  Like in large spaces, small sounds count for a lot.</p>
<p>After a while I rise.  I read that the recording was made in Salisbury Cathedral and the singers are its choir.  I grew up in this city and this space.</p>
<p>The voices now have faces.</p>
<p>I leave and walk next door.  This room is circular with a few metal columns supporting the roof.   Actually this room is not round but many sided and constructed from thin blocks of concrete (as a friend put it once: a circle has so many sides that it only has one side).</p>
<p>Spherical concrete objects litter the floor, interconnected with thick and hairy rope.  I walk in circles my movement mirrored by the forms of the roomâ€™s inhabitants.  I am reminded of a story I once read in a collection of ghost stories from around the world in which a young boy gets lost in the rainforest and follows thick twines of hair to the centre where he encounters a giant with one eye who eats those whose curiosity lead them to follow the spools of thick matted locks.</p>
<p>The first room was crystal clear.  This one is muddy although there are fewer sounds.  Maybe sounds have filtered in from other exhibits.  The sounds have ended their pilgrimage reduced and stripped bare: hollow and muffled bass, skittering treble, thin and reedy alto, cloudy and fuzzy tenor.  They cannot keep their form here and with small sighs let themselves fall apart and join the tepid sea.  No definition, not even the buzz of a crowd.  Here the echoes of echoes of the earth sound and mumble incoherently.  The floor is a dessert of spheres and the hum is the forgotten library of distant sounds.</p>
<p>I go once more into the first room to try and find voices I am familiar with but return with inconclusive results.</p>
<p>I am unwound enough to find the Rothkos exhilarating, the Kepes unnerving and the Braques scintillating.</p>
<p>I leave.  I was beaten down and opened up then thrown gamely until I no longer resembled any familiar shape.  On exiting though the turbine hall the enormity compressed me into a speck of hardened and fossilised wood.  All of my sundry parts were recalled from their distant dimensions and hidey-holes, pressed back into service and recommenced as assets.  On leaving the vastness leaves me suddenly and I find I fit back in normally although I still tremble from the strength of the forces that have passed through me.</p>`
