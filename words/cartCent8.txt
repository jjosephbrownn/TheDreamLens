`<h1>Soil and bones</h1>
<h2>Unearthed by Autumn Andersen</h2>
<p>At some point in the transition from Mesolithic to Neolithic periods of the stone age, around 12,000 years ago, the concept of the afterlife started to take shape in western Europe.  Coherent forms of burial and memorial started to appear in the shape of burial mounds, chamber tombs and inscriptions detailing supposed passages to the land of the dead.  Alongside this conceptual shift was a transition in the imagination that allowed early humans to project identity into death.  Palaeo- and Mesolithic burial remains are strangely archival and indexical in that they are collections of remains ordered by type – thighbones with thighbones, skulls with skulls etc.  This suggests that death was a redistribution of matter and a dissolution of a temporary convergence that was constitutive of a living subject.  At the turn of the Neolithic however, it is to be supposed that communities started to understand that the character and consciousness of a person might transcend death and travel on into a new realm where life is not tied to the seasons.  Burial remains are ordered by body, by subject.</p>
<p>The settling of nomadic peoples advanced a sedimentary individuation.  Identity becomes structured and finite, bodies are enclosed within exoskeletons.  Identity ossifies in death and is trapped by the totality of the body with not one piece missing.  Take away a finger bone and the soul is trapped.  Evil becomes a supplement; the body is a perfect natural entity to which evil attaches like a parasite.  </p>
<p>Agriculture triggers the delineation of private property, cash economies and the abstraction of human contact into relations of exchange and the calculation of value.  As the quest for and protection of private property spreads across Europe we find that identity becomes less fluid, relations become relations of property and exchange, women are commodified, strangers are inscribed within social orders as deficient and, as such, subject to dehumanization and abstraction.</p>
<p>Marriage and ownership are two sides of the same coin which in itself is a device for stimulating an economy of exploitation.  A whole body of literature is generated to inscribe ideals of monogamy, piety and rationality into the human spirit.  </p>
<p>n short, humans become bodies: they inhere in the bones that support them and are denied dissolution in death.  We developed shells and armour to contain passion and soul and developed unitary subjects that operate on axis of differentiation and taxonomy, irresolute, harsh and unflinching.  Articulated as such, categorized by order and differentiated by relations of interiority which determine objects as having no existence outside of their relational interaction with other objects, the body is organ-ised, turned into functioning parts that drive each other but have no autonomy.  Strangers are fuel for this machine, to be trafficked and rotated but not to be understood.</p>
<p>In the burial chambers the bones become undetachable, they must be kept in their strict positions regardless of the gravity that mercilessly pulls them apart, that demands the deconstruction of the body.  The units of the body fall away from each other, the binding principle flees and the strings that bound the body together are evacuated of meaning – we are left with bones that can do nothing for each other, the thing that brought them together has gone.  The Neolithic sought to undo this destruction and in so doing drew thick boundaries around the soul, demarcating the single unit and shoring up the foundations of normative identity.</p>`
