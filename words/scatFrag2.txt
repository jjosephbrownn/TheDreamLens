This was the final straw.  I stood and gazed out of the double doors to the horizon and watched the world grind on a few more degrees, its joints and bearings old and infirm.  Tipped over the balance this hot day had fallen to its knees gracelessly and listlessly â€“ an exploding bottle, the shops closed, the air temperature hitting the apparently culturally embedded threshold of twenty five Celsius which triggers strange social protocols, shifts in behaviour and the encroachment of hideously warped British sensibility on the quiet streets.  Holding the aluminium tag, freshly severed from the now resolutely closed tin of peanuts, I watch the horizon and decide that nothing more needs to be done to today.
