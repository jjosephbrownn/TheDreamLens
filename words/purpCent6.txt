<h2>Atomi-phony</h2>

<p>We have always been fascinated by polyphony.  It feels more like a group effort making a cloud of sound comprised of linked yet independent parts.  Later forms often subject parts to “bass”, “accompaniment”, “lead”, “solo” so that the elements of the music are assigned functions on top of simply “being music”.  Atomi-phony is the same idea but includes all elements.  Looking at a song each part has a job to do.  Atomi-phony ignores function and just looks at the musical existence, the bare-bones of what is going on.  It requires some poetic language and imagination too.  Where many classical methodologies try to understand music through function and place (doesn’t this remind you of theories of social hierarchy and, ultimately, the control of sections of society through class and background?) Atomi-phony embraces subjective and poetic descriptions of not only the actual music but the processes applied to it (what does the reverb sound like? what effect does the panning have on the listener?).  Atomi-phony would understand a song blasted over speakers to the same song played on headphones.  This is particularly useful for music that relies heavily on “orchestration” or the arrangement of basic musical ideas into a complex ensemble of sounds.</p>
<p>Two good examples would be Alt-J and Arcade Fire, two groups who have a strong grasp of the power of orchestration.  Most of the material is simple but the way it is combined and shared out amongst the musicians adds an astounding amount of complexity to the sound.  Although using mostly conventional instruments these groups obviously do not think in terms of “rhythm guitar”, “drums” and “lead” or whatever.  The parts are non-hierarchical and perform outside of standardised musical functions.  Another example would be the two guitarists in Television neither of which is lead guitarist and neither is rhythm.  They play equal but different roles.</p>`
