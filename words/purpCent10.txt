`<h1>Interpretative labour</h1>
<p>Unlinking ourselves from the patterns is hard work.  The machines of dulling and blunting have smoothed off all the rough edges, the windscreens are fuzzy with rain and condensation.  Careers are hard work, they cut patterns, in the sense of dressmaking and templates, that can be wrapped and pinned around us.  They also dig channels that soften the critical senses.</p>
<p>In the same way that much of the population is coerced into actual physical labour, there are economies of interpretation and emotion that are equally unquestionable.  Labour should not just be understood as toiling but as rewiring of consciousness in order to survive which is, in turn, slotted into a hierarchy: the managers at the top who issues command and expect to be obeyed and the workers who interpret the commands.  </p>
<p>The hierarchy is important.  Those giving orders rarely have to try and understand others as they are the “creative” class who come up with the ideas; on the flipside, the workers are the “doers” who’s position depends on their ability to work through instructions.  Isn’t it strange then, the decision “who gets to be creative?”.  In a classical sense, the boss is the creative, they have the ideas and the others are the implementers.  Looking at it from another angle however the boss is the staid narrow minded conservative who passes on the actual work, which frequently requires refinement, interpretation, implementation and translation, to the creative class who have to make this stupid dream a reality.</p>
<p>Interpretive labour is drudge work done by a large chunk of the population.  It is the amount of time and energy and emotional strength spent in trying to do what you are told to do.  Let’s striate this idea into some helpful binaries.  White people have no idea of their whiteness, they are not confronted with it everyday, made to feel ashamed or unworthy because of it.  Straight men likewise do not have to constantly labour to make themselves heard, to construct a representation of themselves.  Leninists like to think of politics as representation and performance and economy as ontological.  In this political sphere then, straight white men can relax, take it easy, they are well known characters that everyone can relate to.  The queers, the blacks, the religious others have to spend sleepless nights creating a character that is understandable to these men or else play the dumb and mundane script they have been given.</p>
<p>Interpretation is not paid for.  Like household work, interpretation is carried out for free everywhere.  The world has been made so that some can wonder around without having to think, without having to translate, without having to monitor their words, while the rest not only labour in these fields but labour to maintain the ease of those fluent few.</p>
<p>Interpretation is the ability to understand another’s perspective – it is something we have to do all the time.  What is the other person thinking, what do they want, what do they mean?  We have to do this because the language of the privileged has become so barren and lazy, so user-friendly and optimised that communicable meaning is hidden in layers of abstraction and signification.  These people are not direct, they expect us to do the work of signification for them, to translate the gnomic symbols they give us.  It’s a translation economy where idiot-proof words are exchanged for meaning.</p>
<p>Inherent in interpretation are the tools of anti-racism, abolition and revolution.  To break down the bourgeois symbolic order, the language of privilege, is to expose inhumanity and to radically unwind that particular knot of power.  Lack of interpretative skills allows one to be pro-police, anti-riot, transphobic because it endows one with the assumption that your position is a singularity and the arrogance to believe that we work for you.</p>`
