`<h1>The olfactory part 1</h1>
<p>I was given once, by a partner, a small candle powered water heater for scented oil.  The top part was shaped like a shallow cup can hold a couple of teaspoons of water augmented by a few precious drops of the oil of your choice.  Beneath the cup is cramped chamber large enough for a tealight.  The diminutive flame heats the water and the oil is carried into the air by the steam.</p>
<p>Of late scents have not been a large part of my life.  This large city is full of them and my nose has been overpowered; it no longer demands attention.  It is only when you leave the narrow streets that you realise that you have been force fed a point of view, a particular opinion that has become commonplace, largely held in truth by many of your friends that colours the dank walls of the flat you have found and blinds you to the glaring alien nature of the scent.  This place stinks but we do not know it; we live with it.</p>
<p>Once you do head out, however, we recover (slower and slower these days) this particular sense.  Perfumed grass, hot chalk-dense soil, honeysuckle, damp, smoldering leaves.</p>
<p>Back home we used to set the scene with scent.  Close the curtains, have the kettle on the boil and an incense stick burning (frangipani, bergamot, royal) with sweet, dense smoke that imbibed the clothes you were wearing with the coils of another enclave or the water simmering in the burner, a subtler, more floral fragrance that pervaded rather than arrived, crept and whispered rather than smoldered and sang; green tea and lemon, sandalwood, jasmine.</p>
<p>Jasmine has a special place in my heart.  In the scorching, wet heat I drank iced jasmine tea under a tarpaulin on Jalan Malioboro in Yogyakarta.  The taste is dusty, pungent but sweet, ancient.  Along a crumbling wall high on the hillside above Kotor a jasmine plant clings and drapes, releasing its quiet scent from white flowers as we sip cold water and rakia in the shade just off the obscure path that winds itself up from sea level to a shivering tension among the dusty groves and donkey sheds that cluster around the walls of the fortress, hiding a gaping hole in the battlements allowing the discerning tourist a sally port from which to gain entrance to the walls without paying; knowledge that lends a certain bounce to the aforesaid touristâ€™s step as they saunter past the old man on the stool at the very bottom who asks, not totally honestly, for entrance fees.</p>
<p>From the water dish rise these thoughts.  They were given to me and I keep them, secreted amongst the miniature bottles of oil.  The scenes have gone mostly and the rituals dusty and unloved.  The bowl is a little cracked from when I poured too cold water onto the already burning surface.  The jasmine bottle I own smells of cheap melon shampoo for reasons that are beyond me.  The one who gave the burner to me is gone, but wherever I put this little burner to rest I find it is not too long before they find themselves at home again.</p>`
