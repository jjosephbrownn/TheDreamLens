`<h1>Two stories about sight</h1>
<h2>i</h2>
<p>I am not someone who sees naturally.  There are people who always see the bad in others and certain individuals who, the records have it, see beyond the twining of their time and into the folds of the future.  Mothers see the truth in their children and grandparents see the trail of their past.</p>
<p>I cannot see without two very different slices of glass in front of my eyes or two flimsy plastic slivers clasped to my irises.  If these devices fail I am at the mercy of small print and uneven depths.  I can see but I cannot understand, process, balance or discern and as such cannot do much without difficulty or frustration.  The mechanisms balanced on my nose bend the correct the world so that it is pleasing, bend light so that I can define words, sharpen features so that I can recognise.  These are my real eyes.  My brain only adjusts the pictures against the rippling backdrop of my memory but these frames order and control, direct my gaze to certain features and synthesise (false? creating the world) depth, perspective and focus.</p>
<p>It is slightly disturbing to notice that the words used to delineate sight and vision have some many alter-egos as words for motion and action.  A well-made man of the world going his own way is focussed, has perspective and displays the depth of character required to fulfil all of those doubtlessly essential errands.  Clarity and precision in other words.</p>
<p>In the English language the words “sight” and “site” have the same pronunciation.  I have sight but I might also see the sights which are themselves sites of interest.  If indeed space and vision are linked by a quirk of the tongue, the organ of another essential sense, the important question is therefore: where is my sight located?</p>
<p>The frames that rest on my face are a real part of me and not an acquisition or addition.  They shape my features and are a part of my unique appearance.  I am fairly recognisable by them as the glasses are not entirely unobtrusive and yet they play such an important part in the shape of my head that they often go unnoticed while simultaneously being a statement of my personality.</p>
<p>Sight is the emperor of sensation to whom we tether our other organs.  And Love is blind.  This tells us that not only is Love helpless but supremely helpless, in need of guidance, hobbled and apt to make mistakes.  Is Love irrational because it lacks the ability to see clearly or do we place sight so highly and honour it with the most precious attributes of rational thought and clarity because Love unnerves us by its lack?  It is my thought that Love lacks nothing; it has no need to see my face or the faces of my lover.  We need sight badly and have gifted Love our fear of sightlessness.</p>

<p>Why might Love be blind?  Does it feel its way forward and can it rely on its other senses?  Does it have more senses than usual?  If not then is it really a personification? If it is not a personification then is love not a sense in itself and can it therefore only be supplemented and enriched by other senses rather than led by them?</p>

<p>I have been swathed in cloth and rolled in many layers of linen.  Padded and swaddled thus I have been comfortable but inactive, protected but at the mercy of my armour which is cumbersome and a little hot.  There are currents about me that led me to believe that I was at an oasis, water lapping at my feet and the heat somewhat lessened by the shade of the palms.  The cloth kept the sun off my neck for which I am grateful as I have light skin that burns.  Threadbare as it is the linen does a good job of hiding me from the deep colours and sudden sights of the world at large.  Muffled and reduced the dance continues much compressed so that its spiralling dynamism is muted and inoffensive.  I walk along a street of mild shadow empty headed and unaroused.</p<
<p>I am a lover of thread and weave and brought this cocoon upon myself day by day until I drifted with tails spreading behind me and the sound of rustling fabric betraying my movements.  Make no mistake I saw clearly and marked the movements as they patterned themselves on the soft earth of the sky, raindrops pitting smooth curves until they warp and shatter.  But I also hid and I hid so long that I no longer knew that I was hidden.  Wrapping became clothes and I learned to see through them diligently, passing as a long-settled foreigner who has adopted the customs of a new home.  I even forgot that I was a foreigner and I was beguiled by the rush and hiss of cloth on cloth.</p>
<p>So what happened when I remembered?  Well I suddenly felt uncomfortable hot.  There was no burst of light or epiphany, just sweat and itch and I sweated and itched while I searched for a way out, the knot of the sash.  That was when a hand reached out and tore linen from me.  It was a friendly hand and it had not meant to do so.  In fact my disrobing was my own fault, whirling and weaving and not paying the attention I should have done and a friend’s hand that had been reaching for mine caught the sash that bound me and I fell apart.  We laughed pretty hard.</p>
<p>I am paying for my blindness and my burrowing into the folds of my gown.  I feel exposed and those who know me see me anew which is frankly unnerving.  But the wind makes excuses to touch my face and the sounds of the street curl casually into my palm as they never had done.  I am naked but grasp the apparently cluttered and disordered nature of the world which, under my linen shroud, had seemed listless and contained. </p>

<p>Rolling and tumbling and then falling through the messy strata many floors below us.  The detailed structures I had been tinkering with for a couple of years looked stilted and ridiculous and down they came, devastating and necessary and terrifying.  Instead of living here, building a nest in this small corner the design had overtaken me and it how it had towered over me, casting shadows and dwelling with a gloomy weight when it should have been light, airy and spacious.</p>
<p>And now I cannot see.  I sat on the bed holding my broken glasses and trying in vain to tape them back together and making all of the wrong decisions because of the amount I had drunk.  We did laugh about it.  I gave up and started to accept the days ahead full of squinting and missed steps.</p>
<p>This was a ditch and crossing point.  I had seen too much and my memories had seized up and become over-saturated, the mechanisms for emptying, recycling and refilling had packed in but the light continued to flood my retinas.  I had no choice but to continue receiving and storing, the images over-exposed, tinny and distorted until the clamour filled my ears.  I passed on handfuls as I could to those who were willing but still it spilled over the edges and down my front soaking my shirt and filling my boots.</p>
<p>After it all had seeped away, the echoes subsiding as the flotsam washed into odd corners I thought it over.  I should have realised that this was only a spectacle: a staged release of energy and frustration, basically empty.  Nothing had actually changed yet. This was only the warm up, rubbing hands to get the circulation going.  The actual shifts happen backstage quietly but momentously and allow us to run the events of tumbling and harrying again away from the fire and lightning.  With new eyes we can see what we have done.  Without this subtle act, payment for the hand that shows us the path, the falling brickwork and demolished masonry is nothing but ruin, empty effects and we carry on as before with only an added awareness of slipping mortar.</p>
<p>The broken frames I hold in my hand were used draw a world in front of me and to press upon me the importance of sightfulness.  Everything must be corrected and laid out, accessible with a single glance.  My vision is full of sights but they do not appear as peaks rising out of the clouds but as an aerial photograph.  Sights abstracted from the flow of the world and the torsion of object and space, flattened and sharpened.  All I see is peaks, sight after sight, landmark on landmark without valley or path to define them, a thousand eyes without the relief of eyelids.  And so the site is now in the panes of glass, the place of my sight is extended a few inches from my retina and oversees the transformation from sightlessness to sightfulness, one extreme to the other.  My vision is now a situation and the landmarks duly play their various parts.</p<
<p>And so the small change occurred in the breaking off of the left stem of my glasses and passing from seeing to not-seeing.  As I had failed to see properly the playful lights and spinning dancers, and as I refused to look away from the minutiae and lay my eyes on the simplicity of the recurring patterns beyond I had my sight taken from me.  Through the years I had climbed higher until I could view so much and be dazzled so intoxicatingly by the winking stars: and I couldn’t see a thing.</p>
<p>I have to sit here quietly, short-sighted and lift the important things up to my eyes so I can see them properly.  I have fallen from focus and clarity into a wonderfully vagueness and unformed mess in which, as I bring them closer and closer, I can now see the beautiful detail of the two eyes looking back at me.</p>`
