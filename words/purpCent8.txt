`<h1>Extract from <i>Soundmarks and Musical Topography</i></h1>
<h2>Experienced Time</h2>
<p>Music is enslaved to time.  We are all enslaved to time.  we would like to have a think about what it means to talk about time in later writings but right now we will assert it as one of the most meaningful parameters of music apart from Sound.  Time and duration are closely linked although duration is the passing of time and its measure.  Sounds objects of all descriptions must have duration or a time-stamp (a duration requirement).  Duration is as fluid as the definition of a sound object (a composite sound object might have a composite duration).  There are many layers of duration including between pieces, jams, performances or between ideas and structures.</p>
<p>Time is malleable and can be contorted so that an hour can last a second or a moment distended indefinitely.  Think of time as a drone, it happens discretely and continuously.  Time happens, happened and is happening.  If a moment of time is captured and duplicated what does “duration” mean?  Several times we have found ourselves caught in a moment in time (metaphorically to do with mental space and musical reference and memory and also seemingly physically the normal marks of the passage of time, ease of tension, pulse) are suspended and the gesture caught up in its time moment could be repeated identically with an infinite amount of change.  Time creates things like boredom, relaxation, change, similarity when it asserts itself through a medium like music.  For example we become bored when listening to some music over and over again and can never retain the state of pre-boredom which means time has inhabited the music and located it too strongly within a narrative timeline (in this case familiarity leading to boredom).  At other times we have listened to something and found we can just keep listening with no change in state.  This happens frequently when dancing (movement and meditation) but also when listening to something banal.  Autumn used to really like Tom Petty (about 10 years ago) and he and his flatmate once listened to a whole 2 disc boxset without getting tired of essentially the same song and actually enjoying it and laughing along, “not sure what you’re doing Petty but you’re hitting all the right buttons,  keep them coming”. </p>`
