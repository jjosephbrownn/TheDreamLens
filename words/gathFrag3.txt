I work late once or twice a week and the other day I punctured my back tyre riding over some broken glass neatly sown across the bike path to my flat.  So I was walking home and it was about 1230am.  Had my cans on and no one was around so I was just drifting home without paying much attention to anything.  Up ahead was a zebra crossing which I started to cross no problem.  Halfway over I noticed a swift set of paws heading straight for me.  It was a tortoiseshell cat and it came padding quickly up to me like it needed something bad.  Its path remains in my head because it wasn’t like it was coming down the pavement towards me or following some other existing route.  I was in the middle of the road and it came smoothly towards me from the opposite pavement about 10 meters to my left, leaving the curb and heading into the centre of the road.  It had seen me and came to get me.  We both stopped and pondered each other.  It rolled over and I scratched its tummy.  Slowly I continued my way home and the cat got up and followed me.  We walked side by side for a bit in companionable silence.  For some reason Cat decided to skim scamper away from me and jump up on some sort of wooden bench construction thing outside a silent sleeping cafe.  Cat dipped its head into the space behind the bench then looked at me expectantly.  I was tired so I walked off but looked over my shoulder a few times to see, every time, Cat looking after me.  I wish I had stopped then, walked back and seen what it was Cat wanted but I have to say that I didn’t  The last time I looked back Cat had melted into the dim shadows hugging the brick wall of the shop.  I never saw Cat again so I can’t say where it went or if it ever came back.
