`<h1>The olfactory part 2</h1>
<p>Lining up at the gates we pass through, clocking in.</p>
<p>The scent of the place saturates our clothing and mashes into even the toughest fibres.  Before long, even retreat into the neutral, sweet smelling countryside is not enough to rid our noses of the stink.  Labouring each hour of the day we produce this muck and it sticks to us.</p>
<p>Burning engines and fumes, turning wheels and the conveyor belts churning out the usual.  Oil and grease, used coffee grounds and spilt milk, mouldy lettuce.  The walls resound with hammering and splitting and the feeding of the giant furnaces.  </p>
<p>Murray Schafer talks about hi-fi and lo-fi sounds in The Soundscape.  The former are the sounds of hillsides, environments where the smallest susurration is carried to your ears with ease, where you can hear the buzz of insects and the certain way willow leaves hit the waterâ€™s surface.  These are anarchic environments; hierarchy is anathema, the field is a symphony.  The latter is marked by dominance and pollution: the white noise of saturated spectra.  Busy roads decaying into grey nonsense.  The detail is lost amongst the rush of cacophonous harmonics.</p>
<p>The olfactory fills the air with smoke from its three giant chimneys, brick work stained with coal dust.  The gates are resonant brass that hum and shudder discordantly.  Its work force are trembling, deafened individuals faces clogged with soot.  Dislocated from memory and imagination, the two domains called unquestioningly by scent, the workers put aside all fragrance and are aligned in narrow rows, toiling unceasingly. </p>`
