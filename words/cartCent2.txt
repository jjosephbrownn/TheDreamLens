`<h1>Here, there and everywhere</h1>
<p>We take our next steps forward along the side of the motorway.  The sun has stripped us of all our colours leaving only brittle stems of long-bladed grass that pleasantly brush their ankles.</p>
<p>We are heading south and have a few handwritten signs stowed in our bags.  Maastricht, Ghent, Antwerp.  A policeman stops us and redirects us to a safer spot to call traffic.  We move on.</p>
<p>I leave a kiss on their cheek and take a number of steps that may or may not have reached the ground.  The pavement rises up to meet me and I am carried through a sickly-lit cascade of rainwater a-pitterpatter, front covers soaked through.  The bodies are neat and trim settling on their ancestral hills and arching a pose for an attractive skyline palpably possessable if only I could scrape together the last of my change, my last chance for anchoring my drifting selves to one single point forever, around one finger forever.</p>
<p>I come to realise as we sit by the roadside and watch the cars rush by reluctant to pick up two sweaty English travellers, that I find a new face in each place as I leave one behind in the cluttered rooms that pile up behind me.  This journey is masked by the story of two people drawing a wavering line over a map distorted by messy structures that curve space around them and draw the hills close around their shoulders. In fact we are caught on the hard ground of gestation and birth, no sooner renewed, gathering our thoughts from the floor, the many pockets of our rucksacks, the backs of our shirts where they have caught in the fibres and from the hands of a few of the friends we have made along the way, tentatively redrawing them on cheap paper into new likenesses and new lovers and accomplices than we are shattered, wrenched open, disentangled and dispersed on the flat surfaces of the road, our names and faces dissolved again.</p>
<p>These fragments, no matter how often we piece them back together show the fault lines and flaws and the multitude of clamouring voices and appearances of ourselves just like in the coffee shop in Amsterdam where we were too high and the crowd of selves were splayed on the surfaces of the mirrors someone had made the bad decision of installing.</p>
<p>My part-selves are fluid and in concordance, drifting beneath a barely functioning envelope of skin.  We arrive at each new door reassembled picking up specks of dust and window lintels and pitched rooves and bicycle bells with the soles of our feet.  We are many and the stretching surfaces across our avenues and bones flex and shuffle as I am intertwined with the lengthy twists of tonightâ€™s limbs tracing paths and cultivating gently a growing mess of lines and grids etched on the immaterial body behind my eyes.</p>
<p>Arms reach out and hold me and you have forgotten how to speak.  Cool night air picks restlessly at the lock on the door and they listen to the lapping of waves against the far window.</p>
<p>How do I come to so many places and still hold myself together?  I am unformed, a white surface on which sit unrelated organs waiting for the right length of twine to bind them together or the right pencil to redraw the cartography or the right texture of rooftops to contour the even floor or the right mixture of grinding tram wheels and cars on cobbled streets to resonate and ripple the surface, compiling and displacing the intensities of my recollections. </p> 
<p>I come to each with a new assembly of Is. A mouth that connects to mine is not the same when it kisses another; a mouth that whispers into an ear is different to the one that kisses another even if both are mine.  I hold the Heerengracht in the palm of my hand and the waters flood down through the folds just as the ironwork at Eberswalder strasse wrought itself into a nest of skin-creases.</p>
<p>Here we are standing in the square mouths open and guidebooks dangling.  We borrowed a tandem which was fun but probably regrettable when I get round to thinking about it.  Here the deep canals sink lower and cut across our joined envelope, curved with reclaimed land.  Across the weighted shoulders we lie in a dreamy silence and watch the sails of the windmill spin, catching breezes and winding them into tight spools.  Muscles are knotted and the steep eves and teetering frontages are in danger of collapsing unless this pressure is relieved.</p>
<p>Atop a high hill amongst cold war ruins, cloth blown in the wind, a wild walk through city woodland.  I am made anew on each encounter and then and then and then reassembled picking over fragile leaves scattered here and there each brought into knowledge of one another through the echoes of their turning in ruptured space.</p>
<p>I am many and I am fractious.  To be anchored is to seize up and rust, the shifting plates stilled.  I will not be pieced together and made whole as I am me only on the condition that the various shards never meet in the same space.  I gather myself into an assembly of structures old and new webbed with pathways and speak only insofar as I speak nonsense and become only insofar as I overcome.</p>
<p>My feet lead me down this road to another, without route and unbound, these devices attaching here and there and driving forward and then and then and then diverted, allocated a function only to be re-routed and mapped into a recognisable shape, prosthetic names, limbs in common ownership, him, her, torn apart and remade into another body.</p>
<p>I know many hands that I can hold tenderly.  I take those steps forward, each stride a different self, the ancestry of prints behind me obscuring the crowd of soles that formed each mark in the dirt. </p>`
