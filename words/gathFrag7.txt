I gathered everything greedily in my arms and turned them suddenly out into the new air above me so that they scattered and tumbled, dithering and sometimes colliding until the last of the flight is used up.  Now they hang in their gifted constellations.  If you stand amongst them it is possible to draw patterns out of the noise, networks and weaves, filaments unseen between planetary bodies.  It is pleasant to walk around for a while but I have been taught that I need to find a centre of gravity.  I have to build foundations and on top of that a floor.  Matter will need to be collected and compacted and this will inevitably disrupt the constellationâ€™s equilibrium.  No sooner than the field announces itself than the bodies will fall to the new earth, falling from their hooks in the heavens.  
I can feel the tug becoming stronger as I make my steps in this particular direction.  Ahead of me shapes start to coalesce and the mist begins the clear.  With each passing moment gravity becomes more assertive.  I am regretful and I fight the pull.  I have gifted these bodies with space but gravity and earth conspire to give each a purpose and a universal nature in their anchoring.
Along the top of my room clatter dry seed pods and browning leaves.   They have been dislodged from the trees at the roadside by the high October winds and they collect here above me.  Their brief flight is transformed into a desperate dance, spinning patterns on the tiles.  They lose a dimension on which to sketch but gain subtlety of expression on the remaining two.  They gather and eventually settle cosying down amongst the other itinerant autumnal drifters, quietening their voices and stilling their feet.
