`<h1>Wearing Skins</h1>
<p>Billowing through layers of floating cloth looking for the surface<br>
In chilly rooms that no longer have anyone in them<br>
we have no idea how deep this goes<br>
but the resonances passed up to us<br>
have the ring of age about them<br>
and the musty dusty smell of many years</p><p>Spreading silk over the surface of the evening calm sea<br>
shards of silver clink against one another<br>
caught in the net that they anchored to the deep bed<br>
to waylay absent-minded travellers<br>
or undecided curious wanderers</p><p>the silver is to be found in eyes<br>
the pools of differing shades<br>
slender flakes and brittle leaf<br>
a hard and bright core <br>
that shines</p><p>after soaking up the words <br>
and winding the thoughts<br>
and knotting the fears<br>
placing lovingly the unsaid in cloth lined trunks<br>
peacefully listening as they fade<br>
listening until inaudible<br>
although still they resonate</p>
<p>if ears that could hear<br>
pick out those subtle harmonics<br>
threads in the breeze, tightly woven<br>
yet soft as air<br>
this is where the unsaid starts<br>
and taking these echoes <br>
shadows of deep thoughts <br>
before even they were born to the air<br>
we weave and wear the skins of others<br>
so as to be pleasing to them</p>`
