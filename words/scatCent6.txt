`<h2>+++CU Records 330.992 WH, Fragment 12: “Lecture notes 2” – extracted from discontinued programme <i>“The history of madness”</i> by Prof Wallace Arbroath, senior lecturer.+++</h2>

<p>Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries humans spent a lot of time thinking about whether they were living in a simulation.  The inquiry was a broad one and followed several lines of thought each with their own distinctive cocktail of paranoia, speculation, gloom and irony.  What was the nature of their consciousness? Did free will exist or was it a placatory gesture? Did aliens control their every thought? Would anyone realise if they did? If it was looking like technology was reaching the point where AI and simulation were becoming more of a possibility then perhaps the revolution had already happened.  After all hadn’t GCHQ know about the "P versus NP problem"  before everyone else and had simply been forced to wait 10 years to come over all smug?</p>
<p>These questions suddenly were answered in one handily coherent shit storm on the evening of May 27th 2025 when a delegate from the Ontions (whoever they were) appeared at the summit of that year’s UN general assembly to announce that humankind had been under the baleful watch of the Ontion Earth Control programme and had been since the 1500s.  Indeed the extent of their control was more shattering than that.  Not only were humans being monitored, their behaviour logged in huge archives and their thoughts read by probes but, sometime in the early 1600s the Ontions had started to manipulate human consciousness and found it surprisingly rewarding. </p>
<p>At first the Ontions had kept themselves to simple experiments of morality and so forth making their human subjects act in monstrous ways carefully calculated in laboratory conditions to stimulate moral outrage.  From here the scientists had become tired with watching waves of panic, madness or sentimentality and had started to structure a programme of emotional detachment so as to order humankind into a system of emotional purity, simplicity and order.  It had not, seemingly, gone particularly well as the Ontion scientists had been unable to totally control their subjects’ movements and had been limited to emotional manipulation through hormone level control.  The result was a serious wave of angst, paranoia, depression and detachment.</p>
<p>This had not been a serious problem up until the turn of the 18th century when Ontion controllers had attempted to extend their influence over the planet by speeding up technological progress.  They planted the seeds of industrial revolution, global markets and various progressive ideals such as international citizenship in the minds of certain powerful and influential figures.  It seemed to be progressing fine until a rather ineptly planned familial dispute brought on a major European conflict and then, in attempting to revert to normal broadcasting, a second war of immense proportions fired by a handful of charismatic personalities the Ontions had moulded to try and handle with the mess of mud and limbs.</p>
<p>Things started to get really out of hand when the internet happened.  This had briefly surprised the Ontions who had, up until now, believed that they had largely been in control of human creative achievement.  However, it seemed that humankind had started to build its own virtual world that would underwrite the virtual world they were currently living in. The Ontions stood by, baffled, as humans melded themselves with the electrical net.  The huge bloom of technology and space and social relations played havoc with the scientists’ experiments as the assumed boundaries of physical bodies, space and time melted into nothing allowing the emotional DNA, the codes and scripts of the Ontion’s experiments to spread. diversify, deviate and evolve in directions presumed to be impossible.  The Ontions watched on in horror as their carefully designed test tube dissolved and the variables multiplied in unforeseen and frankly terrifying directions.  It was at this point that it was deemed rational to intervene directly with human affairs and to alert them to their situation.</p>
<p>The information spread fast.  Governments briefly tried to suppress the news and to collude with the Ontions in an attempt to maintain their power over the large majority of the planet but were brushed aside by the same mechanisms that had caused the catastrophe in the first place.  Soon pretty much every media outlet was blasting the news across the surface of the planet causing panic and disavowals to thunder throughout every conceivable community.  Now everyone knew that they had been living only a partial life.  How much of their emotions and thoughts had been controlled? Who knew what an authentic, adult emotional reaction was anymore?</p>
<p>This did not come as a total surprise for everyone as may be imagined.  It had long been understood in several communities that if it ever came to the point that great thinkers began to approach the problem of human consciousness via ideas of simulation through advanced technology then it may as well be constructive to believe that the simulation had already begun. If humans had eventually got round to the idea then it would stand to reason that some more advanced race had got there first and were clever enough to keep themselves under the radar.  It was simply too arrogant to assume that humankind had complete autonomy over its own reality.</p>
<p>The Ontions had finally owned up to their planetary blunder and confessed to the baffled humans that it had been they all along who had been propagating detachment, confusion, instability and erratic behaviour.  Granted many of these problems were caused by the meshing of Ontion Thought Protocols and human cyber societies but no one felt inclined to argue that point.  In effect sadness, despair and depression had been forced on humans from above although the Ontions would often pedantically retort that they were guilty only of creating emotional instability, the depression and sadness being only a by-product of the confusion and general mess.</p>
<p>This was of course obvious to a very large group of people who did not own a philosophy degree.  Indeed it became almost a sign amongst equals as the fish had become to first century Christians living in ancient Rome.  To these people who often shared no other cultural or physical bond the idea that someone had been controlling them from the off came as something of a relief: “so it was out of my control”.</p>
<p>he Earth was in chaos as scientists and politicians alike attempted to untie the complicated knot of emotional baggage left by the aliens.  Who was in charge? Which governments were legitimate? and other boring questions were fired around.  Everyone else just had to figure it out for themselves.  Everyone was faced with the horrifying conclusion that much of their life had been manipulated, decisions made for them and investments both financial and emotional made under now apparent duress.  It all fell apart.  Couples began to mistrust each other, long-time partners started to question their commitments, others used the recent news as an excuse to party and practice long-suppressed adulterous desires.  The world in general, it seemed, no longer trusted their feelings.</p>
<p>But then some never had.  Living quietly in England and splitting my time between lecturing at the City University and travelling it had seemed plain to me that I had never felt in control.  The alien revelation and subsequent, and rather tasteless, mourning showed the conceit surrounding our distrust of the voices in our heads.  The hysteria and madness was ample to evidence that we as humans were not angry that someone out there had the temerity to root around in our minds and fiddle with all the settings but that they had come clean and admitted it.  We rage now our problems are all our own: “you mean it is our problem?  Why can’t someone else sort it out?”</p>
<p>Funnily enough, it took an alien mid-control plot and the ensuing fallout for our beloved institutions to take the question of mental balance seriously.  The current programme that you are sitting through is part of the profound shift our culture experienced following the Ontion debacle, one which altered the coordinates of healthcare and medical science inexorably.  The cynic in me likes to acknowledge the material causes of this change: we were far more prepared to accept evidence of extra-terrestrial mental manipulation that the apparently ludicrous notion that humans were limited by destructive mental forces.  We just didn’t want to admit it and we were relieved when it turned out someone else had done it for us although the commentators who drew attention to the fact that we must have known about it all along – why else were we relieved and not scandalised? - were silenced.</p>
<p>Blame must be apportioned</p>
